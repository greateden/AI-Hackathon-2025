          <td class="txt"> An Arizona businessman who secured more than $ 1 million in Covid-19 relief funding and then purchased a Porsche and a new home is now facing federal fraud charges. James Polzin, 47, <span class="passive">is accused</span> of filing fraudulent applications for government loans by claiming `` nonexistent employees and revenues for businesses he supposedly owned and operated. '' CNN revealed earlier this month that Polzin obtained at least six loans worth roughly $ 1.2 million from the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP), which <span class="passive">was intended</span> to help companies pay workers during the pandemic. Polzin applied for the loans under similar or identical business names and <span class="passive">was approved</span> for the money last year despite a string of disgruntled clients and a court injunction barring him from illegally masquerading as a CPA. What <span class="weasel">should</span> we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken The criminal charges stemmed from three additional loans adding up to <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 450,000 granted under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan ( EIDL) program, another SBA initiative intended specifically for businesses that lost revenue due to Covid-19. The same businesses that obtained these loans also received PPP loans, and the government cited CNN's reporting in its complaint, but Polzin has not been specifically charged with PPP loan fraud. Read More The government alleges that Polzin purchased an Arizona house in June with nearly $ 400,000 in cash, at least partially funded by proceeds from both EIDL and PPP loans, according to the government. Polzin bought a Porsche the same month, according to government filings, which did not specify whether Covid-19 relief funds <span class="passive">were used</span> for this purchase. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation unit are investigating Polzin, who is now in federal custody, according to a press release. The government convinced a judge that Polzin was a flight risk, noting in court filings that Polzin <span class="passive">is married</span> to a Ukrainian citizen and spends much of his time overseas. He allegedly sold his Porsche for $ 120,000 the day before he <span class="passive">was arrested</span> last week, <span class="weasel">around</span> two weeks after CNN's investigation, while he was on his way to the airport with a one-way ticket to Ukraine. Fake tax preparer gets six Covid-19 bailout loans worth more than $ 1 million `` Polzin <span class="weasel">could</span> easily flee the country and use any funds he has stashed overseas to live out the remainder of his life as a fugitive, '' the government stated in its motion to detain him. The government investigation did not find evidence of legitimate business operations, and many former clients told CNN that Polzin took their money and never submitted their taxes or filed them incorrectly. He has upset so many people that a Facebook group dedicated to his alleged misdeeds has garnered more than 100 members. One client said that Polzin had put his wife's immigration status abroad in jeopardy. Another received a bill from the IRS demanding nearly $ 20,000 after she hired Polzin. They <span class="passive">were outraged</span> when they saw that he had received multiple loans backed by the federal government. Polzin previously did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the recent allegations and has not yet filed an official response to the complaint. In a filing earlier this week, Polzin's attorney fought his client's detention. `` Uninvestigated allegations of other alleged acts mined from the internet <span class="weasel">should</span> not form the basis of a federal law enforcement agent's affidavit, '' Polzin's attorney wrote in reference to the government's use of CNN's reporting about Polzin's PPP loans and allegations from clients. `` Polzin and his company have prepared hundreds of tax returns and it <span class="weasel">should</span> not come as a surprise that <span class="weasel">some</span> customers have complaints.

The attack is the latest escalation in the region impacting Kurdish energy assets. On June 22, a small rocket fell near the field, slightly injuring two Dana Gas contractors, while a second missile attack occurred on June 24, hitting residential facilities operated by the company. The strikes come amid ratcheting tensions between the KRG and the federal Iraqi government over Baghdad's attempt to take control of the Kurdish energy sector, which has operated independently since 2007. The Iraqi oil ministry is attempting to implement a federal court ruling from Feb. 15 that ordered Kurdish officials to surrender all of the region's oil production to the central government. The KRG has rejected the court ruling, and talks between the two sides have failed to achieve any compromise.

          <td class="txt">In this edition of Sliced, the 3D Printing Industry news digest, we cover the latest business developments, partnerships, and acquisitions in the additive manufacturing sector. Today’ s edition features upcoming launches at the 2022 AMUG Conference, new 3D printing partnerships, business updates, new additive manufacturing materials, and <span class="weasel">several</span> novel 3D printing applications, including a futuristic sunflower village and a successful life-saving 3D printed beak surgery. Read on for the most recent updates from B9Creations, Tethon 3D, the Danish AM Hub, Braskem, AME-3D, Sentinel, MTC, Photocentric, Nexa3D, Fictiv and more. The Additive Manufacturing Users Group ( AMUG) Conference is returning next week in Chicago between 3rd-7th April, and <span class="weasel">several</span> firms have released announcements leading up to the event. 3D Printing Industry will be in attendance, so get in touch to say hello during the conference. Resin 3D printer manufacturer B9Creations will unveil its large-format customizable 3D printer platform, the B9 Core 5 Ascent Series, at the AMUG Conference. Available in five configurations, the platform is the firm’ s largest to date and is driven by its patent-pending FAST technology, which is capable of delivering volume production and resolutions finer than 25µm. Users are able to customize the build volume, resolution, accuracy, materials, software, regulatory standards, and application of the platform, and can even choose their B9 Expert Team. The company will give a live 3D printing demo of the B9 Core 5 Ascent Series during the conference at its booth ( 23). The AMUG Conference will also see KIMYA, the additive manufacturing subsidiary of French printing and coating firm ARMOR, announce an exclusive marketing partnership with 3D printing ceramics manufacturer NANOE. The partnership will see NANOE’ s Zetamix filaments enter the North American market via KIMYA’ s network in the region. “ We <span class="passive">are delighted</span> to be expanding our distribution channels in strategic regions like North America thanks to our partner KIMYA, with which we share a vision and the know-how in technical materials for the production of finished parts, ” said Guillaume de Calan, Co-founder of NANOE. “ We are fully confident in its ability to represent our filament range in this market and to help us extend the use of ceramic and metallic additive manufacturing on the international stage. ” Ceramic 3D printing specialist Tethon 3D will also be showcasing its new UV resin at the AMUG Conference, developed in partnership with global chemical firm Showa Denko KK. The high purity alumina material <span class="passive">is claimed</span> to be loaded 25 percent higher than other industry competitors, with a ceramic loading of over 75 percent by volume and 90 percent by weight. Tethon 3D will be showing parts alumina parts made using the resin at its booth ( 45) at the conference. “ It had been a pleasure working with the Showa Denko team, ” said Trent Allen, CEO of Tethon 3D. “ Tethon’ s unmatched additive experience based <span class="weasel">around</span> filled UV resins coupled with Showa Denko’ s decades of experience in the inorganics, ceramics, and chemical sectors will revolutionize ceramic additive manufacturing. <span class="weasel">Some</span> ceramic additive solutions have issues with shrinkage which limits features sizes and often creates unwanted warpage. “ This material and partnership set a new standard <span class="weasel">around</span> material properties and reflects the original intent of the ceramic additive manufacturing industry. ” Kicking off this week’ s partnership news is industrial 3D printing service provider AME-3D, which has invested in two Uniontech RSPro SLA industrial 3D printers from Europac3D. The new machines will expand the firm’ s existing capabilities within the SLA and SLS service sectors, bolstering both the quality and size of parts it can produce. AME-3D has installed an RSPro 450 and RSPro 800 which are both equipped with a granite recoating platform to improve machine stability in order to produce high-quality sidewall and detail on SLA components. The machines also have an open-source resin policy, and in AME-3D’ s case the RSPro 450 can run Accura Xtreme Grey to continue to supply its existing customer base with parts made from the material, and Somos Waterclear Ultra, while the RSPro 800 can run with Somos Evolve 128 from Covestro. “ The installation of these SLA machines has seen an instant boost to our new business and we are now benefitting from inquiries for larger parts which we previously were not able to fulfill, ” said Rich Proctor, Managing Director of AME-3D. Meanwhile, construction 3D printing specialist COBOD has announced South Asia’ s biggest cement manufacturer Siam Cement Group ( SCG) has become a distributor of its construction 3D printers in Thailand and Southeast Asia. “ 3D construction printers have been widely used in many parts of the world with excellent results, ” said Abhijit Datta, Managing Director of SCG International. “ The technology helps reduce waste and increase construction times with foolproof simulation with minimal numbers of laborers. This is the starting point of this collaboration with COBOD International. Together, we will improve Thailand’ s construction market with the future expectation of extending cooperation in the ASEAN. “ With our regional expertise and domestic solid business alliance relationship, we are ready to assist our partner in achieving long-term success. ” Elsewhere, Würth Additive Group has signed an agreement with Kurtz Ersa to distribute its Alpha 140 metal PBF-LB 3D printer and expand the suite of additive manufacturing technology offerings available from the company. The deal will reportedly broaden Würth Additive Group’ s ability to <span class="weasel">support</span> high-end production by bringing Kurtz Ersa’ s proprietary Perfect Angle Printing technology to the American market. High-speed resin 3D printer manufacturer Nexa3D has teamed up with manufacturing service provider AddiFab to launch a novel 3D printed injection mold tooling platform. The Freeform Injection Molding ( FIM) platform <span class="passive">is based</span> on 3D printing technology that allows the user to 3D print complex injection mold tooling in a matter of hours, rather than weeks or months. The platform’ s tools are compatible with “ most ” thermoplastic materials, including reinforced high-performance feedstocks, to allow the molding of complex components that would be otherwise difficult or impossible to produce via conventional metal tooling techniques. Nexa3D will also supply its NXE 400 system to users of the FIM platform, while Addifab will supply its proprietary tooling resins and post-processing equipment. The UK-based Manufacturing Technology Centre ( MTC) has partnered with ultrasonic measurement products manufacturer Precision Acoustics to bring a complex ultrasonic measurement product to market via 3D printing. Precision Acoustics approached the MTC for help launching a new anechoic test tank liner for measuring ultrasonic signals at frequencies below 1MHz, which required a mold to be produced in order to cast the absorber materials for the liner. The geometric complexity of the mold proved too challenging for convention techniques, and so the partners leveraged the MTC’ s large build envelope 3D printer to produce a full-size liner template using simulated polypropylene material. The anechoic test tank liner has since been brought to market as a result, with Precision Acoustics gaining knowledge of additive manufacturing that its says will benefit future projects. LCD 3D printer manufacturer Photocentric has named Core Technologie spin-off Additive Innovation as its exclusive sales partner for its 3D products in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Additive Innovation will distribute the firm’ s Magna and Opus machines and as well as its flexible resin materials. Photocentric, Additive Innovation and Core Technologie have also worked together to develop the Photocentric Additive Tool, an integrated software that allows 3D models to be read in from common CAD formats and prepared as an exact, intelligent B-Rep model. 3D printer manufacturer 3D Systems, meanwhile, has entered into a joint venture with Saudi Arabian industrial investment firm Dussur to expand the use of additive manufacturing within the country and further afield within the Middle East and Africa. The partnership aims to <span class="weasel">enable</span> the development of Saudi Arabia’ s domestic 3D printing production capabilities, and will initially focus on the energy sector before expanding into other industrial segments and healthcare applications. “ Our partnership with Dussur will accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing in the region, enabling diversification of the Saudi Arabian economy, ” said Jeffery Graves, President and CEO of 3D Systems. “ While the energy segment will be one area of focus, a broad range of applications across industrial, aerospace, and healthcare segments will be addressed. “ We <span class="passive">are excited</span> about the partnership and <span class="weasel">believe</span> it will provide a strong foundation within the Kingdom to expand local engineering and manufacturing and <span class="weasel">encourage</span> green energy sources. ” Moving onto business news now, and private equity firm Sentinel Capital Partners has announced the recapitalization of 3D printing design, software and services provider TriMech. While terms of the deal have not yet <span class="passive">been disclosed</span>, it is known that Sentinal partnered with TriMech’ s management team and incumbent investor, The Halifax Group, which will remain as a minority investor, to take over management of the next phase of the firm’ s growth. “ TriMech is strategically positioned to capitalize on favorable secular trends underpinning the 3D CAD and 3D printing markets, ” said John Gurss, a principal at Sentinel. “ With a talented and committed management team and a highly dedicated team of employees, we <span class="weasel">believe</span> TriMech is well-positioned to continue its rapid growth, both organically and through acquisition. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to partner with the TriMech team. ” Elsewhere, 3D printer supplier Shropshire 3D has reached a new milestone in its mission to <span class="weasel">enable</span> children across England and Northern Ireland to learn about additive manufacturing with the delivery of 3D printing and STEM products to its 275th school. Founded in 2014, the firm supplies MakerBot 3D printers to education settings in order to teach pupils about the application and potential of 3D printing and prepare them for careers within modern manufacturing. “ I am passionate about creating awareness and training to schools across England and Northern Ireland on the Makerbot printer range of products to assist teachers and learners in the development of engineering and design, ” said Paul Brewer, Director of Shropshire 3D. “ An aging workforce means that hundreds of thousands of skilled technicians and professional engineering roles will need replacing over the next 10 years. ” On-demand manufacturing platform Fictiv, meanwhile, has responded to the temporary Covid-19 lockdown in Shenzhen, China, by transitioning its customers’ affected workloads into other regions of Asia and the US in order to reduce the impact on orders. The firm successfully activated its failover systems in order to mitigate the business impact on its customers, demonstrating the benefits of moving away from legacy manufacturing workflows for manufacturers. “ If supply chain and engineering leaders are still wondering how to make meaningful progress to digitally transform their manufacturing operations, they need look no further than Fictiv, ” said Jean Olivieri, Fictiv’ s COO. “ I am proud of the speed and agility our teams and technology delivered for our customers in response to the Shenzhen disruption and am confident we <span class="passive">are prepared</span> for whatever comes next. ” Polish 3D printer manufacturer Sinterit has also made <span class="weasel">several</span> recent business announcements, having signed cooperation agreements with three new partners and opened its new facility in the US. The firm will be represented in the US by new resellers Impac System Engineering in the South, Vision Miner in the West, and Master Graphics in the Midwest. The firm has also opened a new warehouse facility on the East Coast which will help it to accelerate delivery times to its target customers, and “ facilitate formalities to international transport. ” The last of this week’ s business updates comes from 3D printer manufacturer Stratasys, which has made a slew of announcements regarding new resellers, partnerships, and an online e-store facility. First off, the firm has strengthened its network of partners in France with the appointment of three specialist 3D printing resellers for the region: Cylaos, Dome Technic Dentaire ( DTD), and Halbronn. With the new partners, Stratasys hopes to ensure greater agility and maintain premium quality sales, <span class="weasel">support</span>, and service for its French customers. The company has also bolstered its ability to provide technical <span class="weasel">support</span> to French customers through a partnership agreement with industrial maintenance firm Fives. Stratasys and its French resellers will be able to leverage Fives’ 600-strong nationwide team of maintenance technicians to solve technical issues and maintain machine uptime. In addition to extending its partner network in France, Stratasys has launched a dedicated e-store to allow faster and easier ordering of materials and consumables for French customers. Onto novel construction 3D printing news now, and a new “ Sunflower Village ” is being brought to life by additive manufacturing, featuring a central communal area and 19 surrounding houses. The project is the brainchild of architect Valentino Gareri, technology and wellness firm 6Sides, and real estate company Delos, and aims to provide a design template for efficient and sustainable housing communities in favor of urban developments. Each of the single-level houses will be 3D printed using a concrete 3D printer that remains stationary and rotates to the next lot to print the neighboring house. Each home <span class="passive">is shaped</span> for efficiency, with angled roofs to optimize the homes for solar and rainwater collection, and will be fitted with Delos’ holistic in-home wellness platform to enhance air purification, water filtration, and lighting that mimics natural daylight. While the Sunflower Village remains a demonstrative concept for now, the designers hope it will appeal to developers <span class="weasel">around</span> the world as a template for other town facilities like hospitals, schools, government offices or recreational areas. Elsewhere, global humanitarian organization Alight has appointed renowned architect and designer Ronald Rael as its inaugural Alight Artist in Residence. Rael is currently involved in a project to establish a 3D printing system to allow LGBTIQ asylum-seekers to earn an income through ceramics while on their migration journey, and through his residency with Alight will further his research and development of 3D printing using Adobe in order to create sustainable low-cost housing. During his residency, Rael will also work as an advisor to La Fabrica Project in El Salvador, an entrepreneurial training program that works to provide co-created 3D printed projects for vulnerable youth that can be commercialized and pave the way to stable employment. Moving onto materials, and Brazilian petrochemical firm Braskem has expanded its 3D printing materials portfolio to include polyethylene ( PE) and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene ( PP) filaments. According to the firm, the materials are easier to print, have less warpage, minimal shrinkage, and better interlayer adhesion than other comparable products on the market. “ Unlike other materials on the market, Braskem’ s PE is perfect for packaging and consumer applications and can be used anywhere HDPE would normally be used, while our new glass fiber reinforced PP has added strength and durability which makes it a great solution for automotive, aerospace, medical, robotic, and industrial applications, ” said Jason Vagnozzi, Braskem’ s Commercial Director of Additive Manufacturing. The latest annual AM Report 2022 from the Danish AM Hub has revealed more and more Danish manufacturing companies are using 3D printing technology. According to the report, the use of additive manufacturing has increased “ steadily ” from 2018 to 2021, with a third of manufacturing companies using 3D printing technology last year. “ It is absolutely positive that more Danish companies are embracing the technology and thus are able to create a production that reduces the amount of material used, reduces waste and transport, and ends up with more custom-made, circular, and simply better products and items, ” said Frank Rosengreen Lorenzen, CEO of Danish AM Hub. “ Overall, we get a smarter production. “ And this year’ s survey clearly shows that we are successful in our efforts to spread AM technology in Denmark. ” French car manufacturer Peugeot has teamed up with multinational printing firm HP to create a new line of 3D printed accessories for its 308 model, available in black or an eye-catching mint green. The new accessories include a 3D printed cupholder, sunglasses holder, and phone holder all produced in Ultrasint TPU, which will soon be available to buy from Peugeot’ s Lifestyle shop. The car manufacturer has also hinted that 3D printing technology <span class="weasel">could</span> be used on more technical parts of its next-generation road cars in the future. And finally, 3D printing technology has saved the life of a 25 year-old great hornbill bird with cancer of the beak at ZooTampa in Florida. The zoo drafted in a team of hospital physicians, biomedical engineers, and veterinary specialists from two universities to surgically remove the tumor from the bird’ s beak and replace it with a custom-designed 3D printed prosthetic produced by resin-based 3D printer manufacturer Formlabs. According to the experts, the procedure is the first of its kind on a hornbill in the US, and just the second in the world.

          <td class="txt">Mercedes-Benz Sustaineer Concept Electric Van Scrubs the Air | designnews.com https: //www.designnews.com/sites/all/themes/penton subtheme designnews/images/logos/footer.png Spooky Halloween Tech Is Here. Just Look at These Doozies The Mercedes-Benz Sustaineer concept electric delivery van. The electric van has particle filters that collect pollution when the van is in motion. Shifting delivery vans away from diesel engines, which produce excessive volumes of oxides of nitrogen and sooty carbon particulate matter, to electric power can make an immediate improvement to urban air quality. But it will be a long time before delivery fleets are fully electrified, and even then, vehicles’ brakes and tires continue to produce particles that pollute the air. That’ s where the Mercedes-Benz Sustaineer van comes in. The company has fitted the van with a pair of filters that catch fine particles. The one at the front, where the grille would be on a combustion vehicle is the most obvious, but the engineers have also slipped another beneath the rear end of the van, where it can vacuum the particles that <span class="passive">are kicked</span> up from the road. MANN + HUMMEL for the filters, which must be replaced annually. It also installed low-rolling-resistance tires, which are harder and produce fewer rubber particles, and low-wear brake materials, which also release fewer particles. A fan on the front filter means that system is effective not only while driving at low speeds, but also while the van is stationary for charging. It contributes to a 35 percent reduction of fine particle pollution in the vicinity of the van. These are particles as small as 10 micrometers in size ( PM10). The underside filter catches another 15 percent of local particles, for a combined 50 percent reduction in particle pollution <span class="weasel">around</span> the van. This is an average, and the system is more effective in more densely polluted air. So the places that need the air cleaned the most are where the Sustaineer’ s filters work the best. The Sustaineer's PM 10 underside particle filter system. As an EV, the van also helps by not adding to the pollution with engine exhaust. And the brake rotors are ceramic coated cast iron. This, combined with the regenerative braking from the electric <span class="weasel">drive</span> system effectively eliminates wear of the brake rotors and its resulting particle pollution. An 850-watt rooftop solar panel is another item that aims to boost the Sustaineer’ s efficiency. That isn’ t enough power to propel the van very far, but it is enough to help run climate control systems. It can be hard to heat the large volume of air inside a delivery van, so Mercedes aims to heat the driver directly instead. In addition to the familiar heated seats and steering wheel, the Sustaineer has a heated seat belt. Mercedes claims that the belt’ s chest strap is more efficient at transferring heat to the driver than a seat heater. And it draws little enough power that we can reasonably point to that as an accessory that <span class="weasel">could</span> be powered by the solar array on the roof. Every little bit counts, whether it is heating the driver with solar power or vacuuming particulate pollution from urban streets.

          <td class="txt">This year, the world's largest stage for innovation, the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES), had the motto `` Innovation for human security, '' underscoring that it is far more than just consumer gadgets. In fact, Gary Sicuro, the CEO of the Consumers Technology Association ( CTA), the organisation that owns and produces CES, established this theme with a passionate speech regarding global human security for all. Sustainability also works well in this context. After all, the foundation for achieving this goal will be set by our impact on the world. As such, CES 2023 saw innovation, tech, and sustainability go together to a level not seen before and delivered the show's first-ever sustainability panel through a conference titled, `` The Era of Sustainable Consumer Electronics. '' Dr. Jayshree Seth, Bob LeFort, Angela Baker, and John Taylor served as the panelists. Each of them discussed their businesses ' actions to improve their sustainability. `` The most sustainable product is the one that has not <span class="passive">been invented</span> just yet, '' said Dr. Jayshree Seth, a Corporate Scientist at 3M who works in the division that makes its tapes. `` Everybody's thinking about the next tape. But <span class="weasel">some</span> of the new products we launched are, in fact, 'the product that was never made'- they're not taped, '' Seth added. She explained that people tend to expect solutions that look similar to what they're already used to. Using her example of a new type of extrudable tape that <span class="passive">was automated</span> ( using robotics) and bondable yet sustainable, Seth said that its innovations like this are `` needed to make a step change. They create a disruption. '' John Taylor, VP of LG Electronics, spoke about electronic goods ( obviously). Every new technological product, he said, ought to be sustainable. From the beginning of its life cycle until the very end, his business's goal is to ensure that efforts towards that occur for all of its devices. The president of Infineon, one of the biggest manufacturers of semiconductors in the world, Bob LeFort, spoke about incorporating sustainability into products. `` At Infineon, our motto is 'help people to do more with less. ' In a lot of areas, doing good for the environment is also good for business, '' he said. LeFort shared an example about a company called Infinitum that offers a whole new approach to motors. `` They don't use the heavy metal stator; they use this small little PC board, '' he said. Lefort then highlighted that this was a concept for many years and has now been made possible, thanks to technology making it viable. `` It makes more efficient motors; they're lighter and smaller. And so you start to see that there isn't really a penalty to pay when you have this technology and innovation that comes together with the right focus, '' LeFort explained. The Chief Sustainability Officer at Qualcomm, Angela Baker, discussed her organization's objective to achieve NetZero emissions. She asserted that building a solid 5G network will be essential to doing that and assisting other businesses in doing the same. For example, `` [ With 5G ] manufacturing floors will be running more efficiently and more effectively, or large-scale agriculture farms that use Ag tech, '' Baker said. She also noted that 5G enabled-drones <span class="weasel">could</span> reduce pesticide usage. `` This large capacity for data and the low latency that 5G will offer- or that it does offer- really allows it to transform these industries that have been <span class="weasel">around</span> for hundreds of years. But making them work more efficiently and effectively with other benefits as well, '' she said. NASA `` are simply the best in the world at modeling these materials, hands down, '' SMART Tire co-founder Brian Yennie tells IE.</td>

          <td class="txt">The information you requested is not available at this time, please check back again soon. Joachim Nagel, president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, left, greets Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank ( ECB), as she arrives at the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Koenigswinter, Germany, on Thursday, <span class="weasel">May</span> 19, 2022. Germany's Finance Minister Lindner said he's confident that Group of Seven finance chiefs will reach an agreement on additional financial aid for Ukraine. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg, Bloomberg ( Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @ economics and subscribe to our podcast. The days of European Central Bank teamwork heralded by Christine Lagarde <span class="weasel">may</span> be ending as a Bundesbank warning shot on her crisis policies evokes its prior role as a thorn in the presidency’ s side. The public salvo on Monday by German official Joachim Nagel, cautioning on the dangers of an anti-turmoil tool, is raising the temperature just as discussions intensify on a key pillar of the ECB chief’ s plans to raise interest rates. In a possible echo of the ordeal her predecessor Mario Draghi faced during the sovereign-debt crisis a decade ago, Lagarde <span class="weasel">might</span> now face the task of executing a tricky policy maneuver fraught with the danger of market turmoil -- all while worrying about the prospect of a critical German central bank. The comments reflect “ the difficulty in designing such a tool, especially in terms of the trigger for intervention, ” said Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management. “ It <span class="weasel">may</span> also be politics in the sense that you need to sell the tool at home. After all, the president of the Bundesbank has to state his objections. ” The abrupt departure last year of Nagel’ s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, already hinted at difficulties, but the new Bundesbank president had until now stuck a more diplomatic tone when discussing ECB policy in public. What changed was the outbreak of debt-market turmoil in June focused <span class="weasel">around</span> Italy, precipitating a pledge by the Governing Council to develop a crisis tool intended to allow the very rate hikes sought by the Bundesbank to proceed unhindered. Nagel’ s speech suggests that the <span class="weasel">likely</span> shape of such an anti-turmoil measure, and the speed with which Lagarde shifted stance, were too much to stomach. “ Monetary policy must not be driven by what are often very short-lived developments in the financial markets, ” he said. “ Unusual monetary policy measures to combat fragmentation can be justified only in exceptional circumstances and under narrowly-defined conditions. ” Nagel set out strict terms where such a tool <span class="weasel">could</span> be justified, tough conditions when its use <span class="weasel">could</span> be conscionable, and the warning that otherwise, “ one can easily find oneself in dire straits. ” The language used chimed with legal concerns on bond purchases aired by Germany’ s constitutional court, where the validity of any instrument <span class="weasel">may</span> well ultimately be tested. An hour later, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos, in his own scheduled appearance at the same conference, sought to reassure that any use of a tool wouldn’ t be indiscriminate -- holding out the prospect that any measure will be appropriate. “ We will react to prevent fragmentation, with suitable safeguards to prevent moral hazard, ” he said. “ Our commitment to fight fragmentation <span class="weasel">should</span> thus not interfere with, but rather <span class="weasel">enable</span>, a greater focus on the monetary policy stance. Conceivably, an ECB tool <span class="weasel">could</span> just meet the conditions set by Nagel, though his remarks <span class="weasel">may</span> well set the scene for major disagreements ahead. The Bundesbank chief’ s speech provides a glimpse into the hawks’ “ red lines, ” but such conditions can help <span class="weasel">support</span> the ECB’ s credibility and avoid market turmoil down the line, Allianz SE economist Katharina Utermoehl said. “ After all, it would be of little use to put forward a no limits spread fighting tool which only enjoys a short shelf-life. ” Nagel’ s intervention follows in his institution’ s long tradition of seeing itself as a guardian of price stability, a role on which the ECB was then modeled. Inherent in that is a prohibition against monetary financing set in stone in an EU treaty. Against that backdrop, Bundesbankers have frequently protested ECB policies. One president, Axel Weber, quit in 2011 as the euro-zone central bank bought up bonds of turmoil-stricken countries such as Greece. Juergen Stark, the ECB chief economist and a former Bundesbank official, resigned later that year. Meanwhile Weber’ s successor, Weidmann, testified in court against the OMT crisis-fighting tool that Draghi unveiled in 2012. He later accepted its validity when in the running himself to lead the ECB. The advent of Lagarde as president turned a new page. She took a more conciliatory approach than that of Draghi, and both Weidmann and Nagel had largely played along. In an interview just before taking office in 2019, she explained her priority as “ making sure that we are a team, that we disagree amongst ourselves and then, once the disagreement <span class="passive">is settled</span>, once there is a common line, that we all move together. ” It’ s hard to square Nagel’ s public intervention with that approach. This episode doesn’ t yet constitute a full breakdown in relations, but with the likelihood that German public opinion <span class="weasel">could</span> take note, that danger is now coming into view. As businesses and individuals grapple with soaring energy costs, the situation <span class="weasel">could</span> become significantly more precarious if Russia were to scale back oil and natural gas production, according to the head of Whitecap Resources. Canadian business and consumer expectations of inflation over the next couple of years is at a record, according to the country’ s central bank, a worrying development that will stoke bets of more aggressive rate hikes. The TSX Composite closed 167.50 points higher on Monday to 19,028.86 in a broad-based rally led by materials and energy. A much anticipated federal clampdown on a new mortgage product that sinks over-leveraged homeowners deeper into debt has fizzled.</td>

          <td class="txt">At its annual Pharma Media Day 2023, Bayer presented the latest progress in the ongoing transformation of its pharmaceutical business focusing on accelerating innovative healthcare solutions for the benefits of patients and delivering long-term, sustainable business growth. “ The transformation of our Pharma business is progressing well. With bold investments in industry-leading technology platform companies, we have bolstered our R & D capabilities and strengthened our early development pipeline, ” said Stefan Oelrich, Member of the Board of Management, Bayer AG and President of Bayer’ s Pharmaceuticals Division. “ Going forward, we will focus on realizing the full potential of our projected blockbuster candidates Nubeqa™, Kerendia™, asundexian and elinzanetant. We will specifically allocate resources to grow our oncology and cardiology businesses in the U.S. The implementation of our strategy aims to deliver new medicines to patients faster and <span class="weasel">drive</span> sustainable growth across our key areas of focus. ” During this year’ s Pharma Media Day 2023, Bayer showcased how its investments in strategic technology platforms accelerate its medical and digital innovations and will <span class="weasel">advance</span> the company’ s leadership ambitions in cardiology, oncology, and radiology. In addition, Bayer provided insights into its innovation strategy, comprising enhanced research and development ( R & D) capabilities in key areas. “ Patient needs, precision therapies to address disease complexity as well as advances in science and technology are evolving rapidly. Therefore, we are evolving our R & D strategy and operating model to focus on differentiated, high-value breakthrough medicines, ” said Christian Rommel, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer’ s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “ Moving forward, we will focus our early research activities on core strategic areas: oncology, cardiovascular, neurology & rare diseases and immunology, where we <span class="weasel">believe</span> we can make the biggest possible difference for the patients we serve. ” The company has doubled its portfolio of oncology treatments over the past five years. With Nubeqa ( darolutamide) as a key growth driver it is gearing up to become a leader in prostate cancer, the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Nubeqa has the potential to become the standard of care for prostate cancer patients from the early- to the late-stage of this disease. Going forward, growth of Nubeqa will be driven by recent approvals for the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer ( mHSPC) in the U.S., EU, Japan, and China. In parallel, the <span class="weasel">robust</span> Phase III clinical development program with darolutamide aims to broaden its use from the metastatic into the earlier disease stages, e.g. in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk of biochemical recurrence and as an adjuvant treatment for patients with localized prostate cancer with very high risk of recurrence. The company has projected a peak sales potential for Nubeqa of more than three billion euros. “ With Nubeqa’ s potential to set a new standard of care in prostate cancer, its compelling clinical program across the spectrum of prostate cancer and our growing early pipeline, we are well placed to deliver on our commitment to bring innovative medicines to cancer patients, ” said Christine Roth, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer’ s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of the Oncology Strategic Business Unit. “ Bayer has clear ambitions to become a top oncology company. We are investing in innovative treatments and modalities that have the potential to be transformative for a broad range of cancer patients, who currently have little or no treatment options. ” Bayer is advancing its oncology R & D efforts in three scientific areas that have the potential to address unmet needs in cancer patients. This includes targeted radiopharmaceuticals ( specifically targeted alpha therapies), next-generation immuno-oncology and precision molecular oncology approaches. In these areas, the company is advancing truly first-in-class, highly innovative projects in its portfolio. Nearly one third of new molecular entities within Bayer’ s development pipeline <span class="passive">is dedicated</span> to fighting cancer, spanning all phases of clinical development. With recent major investments, Bayer has fortified its oncology innovation engine substantially. The new $ 140 million Bayer Research and Innovation Center ( BRIC) facility, located in the center of thriving Boston-Cambridge, Massachusetts, is home to Bayer’ s precision molecular oncology research group, fostering collaborations in this outstanding U.S. innovation hub, including with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Vividion Therapeutics, which Bayer acquired for $ 1.5 billion, comprises a leading chemoproteomics platform capable of identifying previously unknown binding pockets in undruggable targets to generate first-in-class novel drug candidates in indications of high unmet medical need. This technology and the unique approach of an innovative arms-length operating model have the potential to accelerate the timelines to get assets into the clinic. For the first two programs, which are addressing high profile cancer targets NRF2 and STAT3, Vividion <span class="passive">is expected</span> to file the Investigational New Drug Application ( IND) in the U.S. in 2023. The short- to medium-term growth in the area of cardiovascular ( CV) diseases will be driven mainly by Kerendia ( finerenone), a non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, representing a valuable treatment option for patients with cardio-renal disease. Kerendia is already approved in major markets in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes. Bayer has exclusive worldwide marketing rights for this product including the U.S. The ongoing development program to expand Kerendia into additional indications comprises three Phase III studies: FINEARTS-HF, which investigates the compound in patients with symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; FIND-CKD, with the goal to make the medicine available also to patients with non-diabetic CKD etiologies including hypertension and chronic glomerulonephritis ( inflammation of the kidneys); and FIONA, which investigates finerenone in pediatric patients with CKD and severely increased proteinuria. Kerendia <span class="passive">is estimated</span> to generate peak sales of more than three billion euros. Bayer’ s investigational treatment of cardiovascular diseases asundexian is currently in Phase III clinical development. Asundexian is an oral Factor XIa ( FXIa) small molecule inhibitor <span class="passive">being investigated</span> in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF) as well as in patients with an acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack ( TIA), a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. The respective Phase III clinical trial program, OCEANIC, which has recently started enrolling patients, is one of the largest conducted in the company’ s history. Asundexian, which belongs to a new class of drugs, has a projected peak sales potential of more than five billion euros. “ Cardiovascular diseases can have a <span class="weasel">significant</span> impact on patients’ lives. We are advancing highly innovative projects in our portfolio to address patients’ high unmet medical needs and shape the future in cardiology, ” said Christian Rommel, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer’ s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Research and Development. “ The number of innovative approaches and novel modalities in our portfolio will triple in future. With those we will be able to target pathologies and disease mechanisms that were not druggable before. ” Building on its strong late-stage projects, the company has set a clear directive towards precision cardiology, exploring innovative approaches across a diverse range of modalities, with the <span class="weasel">aim</span> of pushing the boundaries of innovation for patients with cardiovascular diseases with high unmet needs and <span class="weasel">potentially</span> reversing life-altering conditions. Complementing in-house expertise with external collaborations remains a vital part of Bayer’ s strategy to expand its R & D expertise and develop <span class="weasel">robust</span> cardiovascular therapies, with the goal of addressing high unmet medical needs across broad indications, including specialty cardiology and rare indications. Through Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. ( AskBio), Bayer is developing a gene therapy as a potential new approach for treating congestive heart failure. With the acquisition of AskBio, Bayer gained access to an industry-leading gene therapy platform with demonstrated applicability and <span class="weasel">world-class</span> manufacturing facilities. Beyond congestive heart failure, AskBio is also currently advancing four clinical-stage and a number of preclinical candidates addressing medical need indications across a diverse set of diseases such as Parkinson’ s disease, Pompe disease and Huntington’ s disease. Bayer’ s advancements in cardiovascular disease <span class="passive">are enabled</span> by digitalized, decentralized and more diverse clinical trials, as well as partnerships on industry-leading sources of data, such as the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Heart Failure and the Broad Institute’ s Precision Cardiology Laboratory. These initiatives are helping to accelerate the discovery of new molecules and bring new treatments to patients that need them. Bayer is implementing its innovation strategy in radiology, with a key focus on digital medical imaging and artificial intelligence ( AI). The medical imaging AI market is the fastest growing segment within the global radiology industry. The estimated compounded annual growth rate is more than 26 percent reaching $ 1.36 billion in sales by 2026. A cornerstone of Bayer’ s ambition is its recently launched platform Calantic™ Digital Solutions, which delivers access to digital applications, including those powered by AI. It provides an ecosystem of third-party and Bayer products to deliver disease-oriented solutions for radiologists and their teams. The platform <span class="passive">is designed</span> to <span class="weasel">support</span> healthcare professionals at <span class="weasel">various</span> stages of their work, from diagnosis through treatment of their patients. To bolster its position in the medical imaging AI market, Bayer recently acquired the global strategic imaging AI platform and solutions provider Blackford Analysis Ltd, which will operate under Bayer’ s well established “ arm’ s length ” operating model. Utilizing Blackford’ s and Bayer’ s combined expertise in healthcare technology, this acquisition fosters Bayer’ s engagement to <span class="weasel">drive</span> digital innovation in healthcare, with the <span class="weasel">aim</span> to deliver true value to radiologists and their teams for the benefit of their patients. “ Building on a deep medical expertise across a multitude of diagnostic and therapeutic areas, Bayer is a leader in key radiology segments with a comprehensive portfolio that generated close to 2 billion euros sales in 2022, ” said Gerd Krueger, President Radiology, Bayer. “ Expanding our offerings into the field of AI further advances our strong position in this market. It follows our mission to deliver disease-oriented solutions for patients and their physicians. The transformative expansion of our radiology business is a key element of Bayer’ s accelerated digital transformation, which strategically leverages data science and advanced analytics across the value chain. ” Bayer is investing to leverage the power of data and rapidly evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence throughout the entire pharma value chain, from discovery to production. The company is partnering with technology leaders such as Google Cloud and biotech leaders such as Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to access new areas of innovation. In addition, Bayer has built up extensive in-house expertise to transform its development, manufacturing and medical operations to better serve the needs of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems with relevant innovative solutions. Bayer works on leveraging all the possibilities of the technologies while fully integrating all regulatory and bioethical requirements.

          <td class="txt">A day after Elizabeth Holmes testified about her toxic relationship with Ramesh “ Sunny ” Balwani, who served as president and chief operating officer of Theranos, the prosecution dug deeper into that relationship and how it led to the defrauding of company investors. In open court, the prosecution examined hundreds of text messages sent between Holmes and Balwani, honing in on the romantic exchange between the two. According to an NPR report, after having Holmes read the text messages out loud in court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Leach asked Holmes if she was aware that the word love in a romantic concept <span class="passive">is used</span> in the messages more than 594 times. While the relationship between Holmes and Balwani <span class="weasel">may</span> not have been healthy, the prosecution argued that as an adult woman and the chief executive officer of a company, the responsibility for all activities at Theranos was hers and hers alone. And, surprisingly, that appeared to be something that Holmes agreed with on the stand. “ Ultimately, all roads lead to the CEO? ” Leach asked Holmes, according to NPR. She agreed. Then, Leach asked if the “ buck ” stopped with the CEO? Holmes responded, “ I thought so. ” Additionally, Holmes agreed that, as CEO of the company, she <span class="weasel">could</span> have fired Balwani at any time. That was something she also acknowledged was within her power. The prosecution’ s tactics <span class="passive">were intended</span> to show the jury that Holmes was more than just a patsy to misinformation supplied to her, as she attempted to show in her previous testimony. If she did not orchestrate the willful sharing of false information to investors, she was undoubtedly an accomplice to the fact. That argument is essential in a fraud case as the intent to defraud must be clear to a jury. In addition to diving deeper into her relationship with Balwani, the prosecution also spent its day questioning Holmes on Theranos documents that contained the corporate logos of Pfizer and Schering-Plough ( now part of Merck). In previous testimony, Holmes said she was the one who included those logos in reports sent to Theranos’ partner Walgreens. According to NPR, when questioned by the prosecution, Holmes said she did not recall if she had sought permission from the larger pharma companies to use those logos. Holmes also acknowledged that she had removed language from the document shared with Walgreens that had initially prepared the test validation for a medical professional. When the Wall Street Journal’ s John Carreyou originally began his investigation into the company, Holmes testified that she prepared for his interview by meeting with an opposition research firm to secure information on the reporter that <span class="weasel">could</span> <span class="weasel">potentially</span> be used as leverage to ensure a positive story about the company. That failed as Carreyou was the reporter to first break the news on Theranos’ failings and its fraudulent claims. “ I think I mishandled the entire process of the Wall Street Journal reporting, ” Holmes testified, according to NBC. She noted that she and Balwani were “ protective ” of the company’ s trade secrets. Holmes also testified that she mishandled her staff, particularly those who became whistleblowers about the company’ s failings, which included Erika Cheung and Tyler Shultz. Holmes admitted that when Cheung came to Theranos leadership with her concerns about the company’ s technology, she <span class="weasel">should</span> have <span class="passive">been listened</span> to rather than dismissed. “ I sure as hell wish we treated her differently and listened to her, ” Holmes said, according to NBC. “ You know today that Ms. Cheung was right. Isn’ t that fair? ” Leach asked. In her testimony, Holmes revealed that the company hired private investigators to follow the employees and find out who was speaking to the Journal. The prosecution also pointed out the efforts Holmes went to have the Journal kill the story before it broke. She went so far as to reach out to Rupert Murdoch, a Theranos investor who owned the Wall Street Journal, asking his help in killing the article.</td>

Global Polyurethane Dispersions Market <span class="passive">is valued</span> <span class="weasel">approximately</span> USD 1.79 billion in 2020 and <span class="passive">is anticipated</span> to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 6.89% over the forecast period 2021-2027. Polyurethane dispersions are high-performance coatings and adhesives made out of crystalline, hydrophobic polyester polyols, such as hexamethylene adipate, and aliphatic diisocyanatos. Polyurethane dispersions are extensively used polymers with a varied application, including paints, inks, coatings, adhesives, paper, and textiles. PUDs offer <span class="weasel">several</span> advantages, including low viscosity, high molecular weights, and good film forming properties. They are also an excellent choice reducing the emission of instable organic compounds produced by organic solvents. Above mentioned advantages, coupled with the growth of end-use industries such as leather, paints and textile, are driving the Polyurethane Dispersions market. According to national investment promotion and facilitation agency of India, the domestic technical textile market for synthetic polymer <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 7.1 bn in 2020 and <span class="passive">is expected</span> to reach $ 11.6 bn by 2027, growing at 7.2%, while technical textile market for wovens <span class="passive">is expected</span> to grow at a CAGR of 7.4% to $ 15.7 bn by 2027, up from $ 9.5 bn in 2020. USA ranks among the top markets in the world by export value: $ 23 billion in 2018, according to government agency select USA. The growth of textile market will propel the demand from end-use industry for PUD. The fluctuating price of crude oil, from which the PUDs <span class="passive">are derived</span> <span class="weasel">may</span> act as a restraint for its growth. However, PUDs are <span class="passive">being used</span> in many industrial and commercial applications nowadays since many governments have regulated the use of materials which emit volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants ( HAPs).

          <td class="txt">Munich Re and syndicates within the Lloyd's of London market are among the major underwriters for Nord Stream 1, four industry sources with knowledge of the situation said, adding that it was unclear whether they would renew its cover. If the insurance is not renewed, the prospect of the pipeline bringing gas to Europe under the Baltic Sea ever <span class="passive">being repaired</span> and restarted becomes more remote. Even before leaks were found, supplies via Nord Stream 1 had <span class="passive">been halted</span> as a result of a dispute over Western sanctions on Russia, while the newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipeline had not started commercial deliveries. While a claim has not yet been made for the damage and disruption to the pipeline, two of the sources told Reuters, Nord Stream 1's underwriters <span class="weasel">may</span> dispute any submitted on the grounds that the damage was an act of self-sabotage, or of war, neither of which are generally covered by insurance. Amid speculation as to who was behind alleged sabotage that severed the pipelines at the centre of an energy crisis prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Danish police said on Oct. 18 that the damage to Nord Stream 1 <span class="passive">was caused</span> by powerful blasts. While damage itself would not necessarily affect the renewal of a property policy, insurers <span class="weasel">might</span> ask for more premium, said Tim Shepherd, a litigation partner at Mayer Brown. For the underwriters of the pipeline system, which Nord Stream's website says was built with 7.8 billion euros ( $ 7.6 billion) of investment, the stakes are high. Reuters was not able to identify all of its underwriters, but another of the sources said Swiss insurer Zurich also had exposure to Nord Stream 1. Munich Re, Zurich and Lloyd's all declined to comment. `` Even if you are taking a small size ( of cover), it is a big risk, '' one of the four industry sources said. `` The issue is going to be what happens if you can't prove it is a state sponsor ( responsible for the blasts), you end up with a massive claim for damage, '' the source added. Nord Stream 1's majority shareholder with a 51% stake is a subsidiary of Russian energy group Gazprom, which is subject to sanctions by the United States, Britain and Canada as well as <span class="weasel">some</span> European Union restrictions. Two of the sources said renewal of Nord Stream 1 cover by the Lloyd's syndicates would be challenging given the risk of tighter sanctions on Gazprom, which would prevent paying claims. German energy groups Wintershall and E.ON, meanwhile, hold 15.5% each. Wintershall did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An E.ON spokesperson said Nord Stream 1's operating company was responsible for operational issues, including insurance. `` Nord Stream AG remains in close contact with relevant authorities about the recent incident. Due to prevailing uncertainties, we as a shareholder continuously monitor developments and are in close contact with the other relevant stakeholders, '' the spokesperson said. Gazprom and Swiss-based Nord Stream AG, did not respond to requests for comment, while French energy provider ENGIE, which has a 9% stake, declined to comment. Dutch natural gas infrastructure company N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie, which also has a 9% stake, said it would assess the situation as soon as there was more clarity. `` The exact extent of the damage and possible follow-up actions can only be determined after inspection of the pipelines and that is not yet possible at this moment, '' Gasunie said. `` We are in close contact with our European partners and the relevant government authorities, '' it added. 'DELIBERATE ACT '? Nord Stream's insurers will have to prove that its policy does not cover the damage caused by the blasts in order to avoid paying out on any claim, lawyers said. Although property policies typically exclude malicious damage, policy holders often buy extra cover, which is <span class="weasel">likely</span> in Nord Stream's case, legal and insurance sources said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the United States and its allies blew up the pipelines, an allegation that has <span class="passive">been dismissed</span> by the White House. U.S. President Joe Biden has said damage to Nord Stream was a deliberate act of sabotage. The West has not directly pointed the finger at Moscow, which has denied any involvement. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this month that Nordic leaders had told their European partners it was still impossible to say at this stage who was behind the damage. If a Western state actor was found to be responsible, the damage <span class="weasel">might</span> be designated as an act of terror, which one broking source said <span class="weasel">might</span> be covered by insurance. However, if investigations found Russia to have <span class="passive">been involved</span>, insurers <span class="weasel">could</span> argue it was an act of `` self-sabotage '', given Gazprom <span class="passive">is owned</span> by the state. `` If there was a deliberate act by the policyholder, you are not going to have a covered claim, '' said David Pryce, managing partner at Fenchurch Law, which is not involved with the policy. If there was any Russian involvement it <span class="weasel">could</span> also mean the Nord Stream 1 damage <span class="passive">being designated</span> as an act of war, something that is typically excluded by insurance policies.

          <td class="txt">This article originally appeared on Circulate News. Steel is not infinitely recycled. For instance, much of the high-grade steels recovered from vehicles <span class="passive">are downcycled</span> into a lower-price material and mostly reused in lower-grade applications, such as buildings and infrastructures. Indeed, not aware of the quality of the steel they collect, recyclers mix steel grades, producing a lower-quality recycled material. Steel recyclers are not alone having little information on materials or products they recover. Plastic recyclers are not always aware of the full chemical makeup of materials they process, including the presence of toxic substances. Repair technicians don’ t always have access to disassembly guidelines for electrical equipment. Remanufacturers <span class="weasel">may</span> not know the number of operating hours of an electric engine to decide if the engine can be restored `` as good as new '' or whether it <span class="weasel">should</span> be recycled. To maintain the value of a product in the economy for as long as possible, information on the product design, composition and condition is critical. With this information, an end-of-life product can be converted back into a valuable resource. In the transition to a circular economy, the equation is no longer `` waste = resource '' but `` waste + information = resource '' or, as stated by Idriss J. Aberkane, “ waste + knowledge = asset. ” Today, <span class="weasel">various</span> digital technologies <span class="weasel">enable</span> information to travel with a product. These technologies allow us to identify a product and capture, store, share and analyze data throughout its lifecycle. To identify and track a product, two types of technologies exist: attached or embedded anchors. These anchors can be physical ( such as fluorescent markers or watermarks), digital ( such as Radio Frequency Identification or printed electronics), or biological ( such as chemical tracers or DNA markers). For example, P & G is experimenting with digital watermarks, imperceptible code the size of postage stamps covering the surface of consumer goods packaging, that can be detected and decoded by a standard high-resolution camera on a waste sorting line. Another example is office furniture company Ahrend, which uses a QR code to identify each piece of furniture in its product as a service range. Once a product <span class="passive">is identified</span>, data regarding its design, condition or location can be retrieved and information can be updated using <span class="weasel">various</span> technologies. Data capture technologies include sensors or computer vision. For example, robots from ZenRobotics can sort post-consumer mixed material streams through computer vision techniques. Data transmission technologies include Wi-Fi, cellular network, Bluetooth and Low Power Wide Area Network to name a few. The construction equipment manufacturer Komatsu uses satellite communication to collect condition and location data of its machines. Data storage and sharing technologies range from cloud, digital platform, distributed ledger or big data. Thyssenkrupp collects and stores in the cloud operating data of 130,000 of its elevators worldwide to monitor their condition. Finally, thanks to data analysis technologies, such as artificial intelligence ( AI), the capture and exploitation of these often large amounts of data are made possible. For instance, technology company Optoro offers a solution using AI to help retailers and brands manage, process, and sell returns and excess inventory through the highest value channel. Tomra, a manufacturer of advanced collection and sorting machines, uses artificial intelligence to analyze images and data from cameras, near-infrared spectroscopy, X-rays and lasers, sorting waste according to their highest value and best use. Many firms already leverage digital technologies to manage their products’ information. Still, this information is barely shared along value chains, and as a result, most stakeholders don’ t have access to key product data. For example, to extend tire lifecycle, manufacturers equip them with sensors measuring pressure and temperature, but they don’ t share information with collectors and processors that <span class="weasel">could</span> help improve recycling or increase the uptake of recycled rubber in new tires. Thus, due to a lack of opportunity for material valorization, Europe exports more than 50 percent of end-of-life and second-hand tires. Information technology is a key enabler for the transition towards a circular economy, but data sharing across the value chain is also crucial. To exchange data along the value chain, stakeholders need to agree on a common language. For example, <span class="weasel">several</span> businesses from the fashion industry, including H & M, Target and I: CO, have agreed to use a common protocol, Circularity ID, to share information on garment lifecycle. In France, GS1, an organization that develops standards, and Citeo, an Extended Producer Responsibility organization for packaging, worked with brands ( French) to <span class="weasel">support</span> information exchange related to packaging, such as consumer sorting instructions. Driven by the Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy and supported by major international industry companies, the `` Circularity Dataset Standardization Initiative '' aims at establishing an official standard for communicating data on the circular economy properties of products. In Germany, R-Cycle, a cross-industry consortium, is working on an open and globally applicable tracing standard to ensure the seamless documentation of recyclable packaging along the value chain, based on GS1 standards. Product passports are a convenient solution to establish a common protocol and share information on the origin, durability, composition, reuse, repair, and dismantling possibilities, and end-of-life handling of a product. For example, shipping company Maersk Line has developed, in partnership with its suppliers, a `` Cradle to Cradle Passport, '' which lists and describes the materials used to build their vessels, their location and how they can be correctly disassembled and recycled or disposed of. Maersk Line estimates that the passport will increase end-of-life vessels value by 10 percent. The European Commission released a new legislative proposal stating that all batteries ( portable, automotive, electric vehicle and industrial), with <span class="weasel">some</span> exceptions, <span class="weasel">should</span> have a battery passport. This would <span class="weasel">enable</span> second life operators to take informed business decisions and allow recyclers to better plan their operations and improve their recycling efficiencies, because it would improve battery sorting, the health and safety conditions of operations, and even has the potential to increase the purity of the recyclable fraction. If most passports <span class="passive">are designed</span> at product level, there are <span class="weasel">some</span> examples of passports at material level. For example, global steel company SSAB offers a traceability tool called SmartSteel 1.0 that gives steel a digital identity. Customers can identify steel products by scanning its identifier, examine material properties and download certificates. Once data has <span class="passive">been standardized</span>, stakeholders often choose to exchange it using digital platforms. For instance, producers of electrical and electronic equipment use an online platform, the Information for Recyclers Platform ( I4R), to share information regarding their equipment with recyclers, and to comply with European legislation. <span class="weasel">Several</span> large automotive companies have established the International Material Data System, a global data repository that contains information on materials used in the industry that facilitate the recycling of end-of-life vehicles and their materials. Many digital platforms are also used to <span class="weasel">support</span> the trade of secondary raw materials. These marketplaces allow secondary material suppliers and buyers to find each other on a web-based platform. They <span class="passive">are supposed</span> to create more market liquidity and to provide more supply and demand security for recyclers and their customers. Many marketplaces specialize in specific materials, such as plastics ( Scrapo), textiles ( Nona Source), construction materials ( Backacia [ French ]), metals ( Metalshub) or organic wastes ( Organix [ French ]), while <span class="weasel">some</span> others cover multiple materials ( Recykal). At one point, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development identified more than 100 marketplaces, most operating at a municipal or regional level, but most are failing to attract a large number of suppliers or customers. Many made the faulty assumption that `` if we build it, they will come, '' but attracting a critical mass of both buyers and sellers can require <span class="weasel">significant</span> investments. Stakeholders <span class="weasel">could</span> also be reluctant to share data on a platform that, most often, <span class="passive">is managed</span> by a private company. Distributed ledger, the parent technology of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, offers an alternative technology that <span class="weasel">could</span> address this concern. A distributed ledger is a type of database that <span class="passive">is shared</span>, replicated and synchronized among the members of a decentralized network. For example, in France, organic waste producers, carriers and farmers share information on the organic value chain using a blockchain, ensuring the transparency of the organic waste value chain and, at the end, delivering traceability of the fertilizer produced. Many companies from the chemical value chain are experimenting with blockchain technology to improve the traceability of chemicals in general, and plastics in particular, through their lifecycle. Mitsui Chemicals and IBM Japan are working on a resource circulation platform using blockchain technology that <span class="weasel">should</span> ensure traceability throughout the resource life cycle, from raw materials such as monomers and polymers through to the manufacturing, sales, use and recycling of products. Borealis, Covestro and Domo Chemicals have launched a blockchain traceability project, together with Circularise and Porsche. Solvay has begun testing blockchain technology to trace its products throughout the entire value chain in partnership with Chemchain. Blockchain can also be used to share data with consumers. Using blockchain technology provided by Provenance, Royal Auping has created a Product Passport that describes all the materials that go into their mattresses. The passport can be viewed by scanning an NFC ( Near Field Communication) chip on the mattress label with a smartphone, allowing shoppers to view it in-store or at home. Digital technology is an opportunity for the transition towards a circular economy, but it is not a blanket solution and it comes at a cost for the environment. Indeed, digital technologies are responsible for resource depletion. Between 1995 and 2015, the material footprint of digital equipment has quadrupled. The extraction of the raw materials used in this equipment, such as precious metals or rare-earth elements, causes severe environmental damage, including land degradation, water scarcity and biodiversity loss. Most equipment generates a lot of waste. For example, the production of a 3 kg laptop generates 1,200 kg of waste. The short renewal cycle of these types of equipment also causes large amounts of waste. In addition, according to <span class="weasel">some</span> estimates, digital technologies account for 3.7 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In France, digital technologies <span class="weasel">could</span> be responsible for 7 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2040 ( French). And it is worth noting that, over the past 50 years, the development of digital technologies has coincided with the rise of CO2 emissions. The belief that environmental costs of digital technology can be offset by the gains they <span class="weasel">could</span> render is still to be confirmed. Therefore, before investing in new digital technologies, industries will have to validate that the negative impacts throughout the technologies’ lifecycles do not offset the expected gains. The transition toward a circular economy is unavoidable. Digitalization of material and product flows is a major enabler of this transition. Therefore, businesses, industries and governments alike <span class="weasel">should</span> start by building digital roadmaps to answer key questions such as: What are the information gaps that prevent the execution of circular strategies? Which stakeholders along the value chain <span class="weasel">could</span> share these data? Which are the enabling digital solutions to close the information gap? Will environmental costs of these digital technologies be offset by the gains they would render possible? Which open data format <span class="weasel">should</span> be adopted?</td>

          <td class="txt">These venture bets on startups that `` returned the fund, '' making firms and careers, were the result of research, strong convictions, and patient follow-through. Here are the stories behind the biggest VC home runs of all time. In venture capital, returns follow the Pareto principle — 80% of the wins come from 20% of the deals. Great venture capitalists invest knowing they’ re going to take a lot of losses in order to hit those wins. Chris Dixon of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, a CB Insights Smart Money VC, has referred to this as the “ Babe Ruth effect, ” in reference to the legendary 1920s-era baseball player. Babe Ruth would strike out a lot, but also made slugging records. Dig into the latest trends in venture capital funding in the CB Insights and PwC MoneyTree Headline Report. Likewise, VCs swing hard, and occasionally hit a home run. Those wins often make up for all the losses and then <span class="weasel">some</span> — they “ return the fund. ” “ If you do the math <span class="weasel">around</span> our goal of returning the fund with our high impact companies, you will notice that we need these companies to exit at a billion dollars or more. Exit is the important word. Getting valued at a billion or more does nothing for our model. ” We analyzed 45 of the biggest VC hits of all time to learn more about what those home runs have in common. To do so, we pulled data and information from web archives, books, S-1s, founder interviews, the CB Insights platform, and more. For each company, we dove into the remarkable numbers they posted before their IPOs and acquisitions, the driving factors behind their growth, and the roles of their most <span class="weasel">significant</span> investors. Below, we’ ll show you our analysis on each specific case. Note: Unless specifically stated, the “ returns ” discussed in the sections below <span class="passive">are calculated</span> based on the nominal value of the company at IPO or at acquisition. Earn-outs ( such as those that apply to, for example, Stemcentrx) and lockups are not factored into those calculations. Facebook’ s $ 22B acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 was the largest private acquisition of a VC-backed company ever at the time. It was also a big win for Sequoia Capital, the company’ s only venture investor, which turned its $ 60M investment into $ 3B. Sequoia’ s success was built on its exclusive partnership with WhatsApp founders Brian Acton and Jan Koum. Typically when early-stage investors put cash into a company, they want to bring on additional investors to drum up more buzz and validate their investment. Startups can end up with as many as five or six different VCs in their cap table. This is common enough that these rounds are often referred to as “ party rounds. ” WhatsApp and Sequoia Capital followed a different strategy: Sequoia was the sole investor in WhatsApp’ s $ 8M Series A round in 2011, which valued the company at $ 80M. Sequoia was the sole investor in the subsequent Series B round as well. WhatsApp’ s founders are known to be iconoclastic. For example, pretty early in the company’ s history, they wrote a manifesto against advertising and vowed they would never make money from placing ads in the service and mucking up users’ experience with the app. So it’ s not shocking that they chose to cultivate a single VC as an outside source of capital while raising only $ 60M of outside equity financing. Sequoia, for its part, signaled its conviction in WhatsApp’ s bright future even as the app scaled to hundreds of millions of users with negligible revenue. When firms invest with that kind of conviction, they get a large share of ownership — as opposed to when they join a deal with a crowded field of other VCs. For example, by the time Twitter had raised $ 60M, it had brought in well over a dozen outside investors. At exit, lead Series A investor Union Square Ventures owned just 5.9% of Twitter. In contrast, WhatsApp had expressed a desire to only work with a single firm from the beginning. Sequoia’ s well-known trajectory as a Silicon Valley kingmaker and its deep pockets helped it beat out micro-VC fund Felicis Ventures and others for the deal. After an initial $ 8M investment in WhatsApp’ s Series A in April 2011, Sequoia put in an additional $ 52M in July 2013. When Sequoia invested that additional $ 52M at a $ 1.5B valuation, WhatsApp was doing $ 20M in revenue — meaning Sequoia paid for its shares at an eye-popping 75x+ revenue multiple. It paid off. By the time Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $ 22B, Sequoia had invested a total of $ 60M for <span class="weasel">around</span> 18% ownership. Its share was worth more than $ 3B, a 50x return overall. For Sequoia, the fact that WhatsApp <span class="passive">was acquired</span> by Facebook was a satisfying win for another reason. Ten years prior, Mark Zuckerberg ( egged on by Sean Parker, who held a grudge against partner Michael Moritz) had shown up deliberately late to a pitch meeting with Sequoia. The meeting was meant as a prank — Zuckerberg never intended to let Sequoia invest. He arrived in his pajamas and presented a Letterman-inspired anti-pitch deck entitled “ The Top Ten Reasons You <span class="weasel">Should</span> Not Invest. ” “ I assume we really offended them and now I feel really bad about that, ” Zuckerberg later told journalist David Kirkpatrick. Making $ 3B+ off selling WhatsApp back to Mark Zuckerberg surely took <span class="weasel">some</span> of the sting off that memory. As well as not <span class="passive">being invited</span> to invest in another one of the top VC deals of all time — Facebook. Facebook ‘ s $ 16B IPO at a massive $ 104B valuation was a huge success for early investors Accel Partners and Breyer Capital. The firms led a $ 12.7M Series A into Facebook in 2005, taking a 15% stake in what was then called “ Thefacebook. ” At the time of the investment, the company had what <span class="passive">was considered</span> a sky-high $ 100M valuation. It wouldn’ t be until almost exactly one year later that investors really started flocking to the early social media startup. In 2006, amidst high user growth and revenue numbers, <span class="weasel">several</span> firms took part in Facebook’ s Series B: Founders Fund, Interpublic Group, Meritech Capital Partners, and Greylock Partners backed the $ 27.5M round, which put Facebook’ s valuation at $ 418M. Even after selling off $ 500M in shares in 2010, Accel’ s stake was worth $ 9B when Facebook went public in 2012, ultimately giving Accel Partners an enormous return on its investment. This bet made Accel’ s IX fund one of the best-performing venture capital funds ever. It was also a bet that Peter Thiel, the very first investor in Facebook, missed out on. Thiel became an outside board member with his $ 500K seed investment in Facebook in 2004. At the time, Facebook had what Thiel called “ a very reasonable valuation ” and about a million users. Thiel saw Facebook’ s unprecedented popularity firsthand. He didn’ t invest again alongside Accel and Breyer simply because he felt the company <span class="passive">was overvalued</span>. When Facebook raised its subsequent Series A just 8 months after Thiel’ s initial investment, he ( and much of Silicon Valley) felt that Accel had vastly overpaid. Thiel made a classic misstep: he failed to perceive exponential growth. For context, Facebook would turn out to actually look cheap at IPO in retrospect, when its IPO valuation to trailing revenue ratio <span class="passive">is compared</span> to that of later exits Twitter and Snap. Thiel would later call missing out on the Facebook round his biggest mistake ever — and the one that taught him the most about how to think about a company that “ looks ” overvalued. As he later wrote, “ Our general life experience is pretty linear. We vastly underestimate exponential things... When you have an up round with a big increase in valuation, many or even most VCs tend to <span class="weasel">believe</span> that the step up is too big and they will thus underprice it. ” Today especially, it can be hard to see how Facebook was ever “ overvalued. ” While Facebook’ s 2B+ active users is impressive, the company’ s early exponential growth is even more impressive. On the other hand, imagine looking at Facebook’ s monthly active user growth from the perspective of a potential investor in its Series C in 2006. Facebook had about 12M users as of 2006, when it was still focused on the college market. Given that between 15M – 20M people attend college every fall, there was still a reasonable chance ( at this point) that Facebook would remain in an academic niche and fizzle out when introduced to the wider world. Investors had no way to know that people would stick <span class="weasel">around</span> after graduating. They couldn’ t know it would catch on outside academia, and later, in other countries. That’ s why Accel and Breyer’ s investment at $ 100M seemed like an overvaluation to Thiel and others. For Thiel, in hindsight it’ s clear Facebook’ s growth wasn’ t following a predictable, linear model. In fact, because it was actually growing exponentially, and the company <span class="passive">was undervalued</span>. “ Whenever a tech startup has a strong round led by a top-tier investor ( Accel counts), it is generally still undervalued. The steeper the up round, the greater the undervaluation, ” Thiel later wrote. Of course, Thiel is in part being provocative. It’ s also possible for there to be pricey rounds that don’ t shake out. It comes down to conviction. An investor must have strong convictions about a company to follow on in the face of a steep valuation jump. When you have strong convictions, you can do whatever you need to do to expose yourself to as much of the upside as possible — as Eric Lefkofsky did after he helped found Groupon. Groupon ‘ s IPO in 2011 was the biggest IPO by a US web company since Google had gone public in 2007. Groupon <span class="passive">was valued</span> at nearly $ 13B, and the IPO raised $ 700M. At the end of Groupon’ s first day of trading, early investor New Enterprise Associates ‘ 14.7% stake was worth about $ 2.5B. But the biggest winner from that IPO was Groupon’ s biggest shareholder, Eric Lefkofsky. Lefkofsky had <span class="passive">been involved</span> in Groupon as a co-founder, chairman, investor, and biggest shareholder. He positioned himself on both sides of the Groupon deal through <span class="weasel">various</span> privately owned investment vehicles and management roles. The way he did this was controversial. In the end, however, he owned 21.6% of the company. When Groupon went public in 2011, his share was worth $ 3.6B. It all started when Lefkofsky helped get Groupon off the ground. He met Groupon co-founder Andrew Mason when Mason started working for Lefkofsky doing contract work. In 2006, Mason told Lefkofsky about his idea for a crowd-sourced voting site called The Point. In 2007, Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell seeded The Point with $ 1M. By 2008, The Point was struggling. Lefkofsky noticed <span class="weasel">some</span> users had used the platform to buy something together in a big group and get a discount. Seeing that this one-off use case <span class="weasel">could</span> spin out into a much more successful business, Lefkofsky helped Mason pivot The Point into the company that we know as Groupon. Groupon’ s subsequent rounds of funding saw the company bring on New Enterprise Associates ( NEA) for its Series A, Accel for its Series B, DST for its Series C, and Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and more for its $ 950M+ Series D. But none of those investors did as well as Lefkofsky at IPO. Lefkofsky amassed 21.6% of the company by the time of the IPO, 1.5x more than the second-largest investor NEA, and 2.8x what co-founder and CEO Andrew Mason received. In his roles as co-founder, chairman, and earliest investor, Lefkofsky assumed the plurality of ownership in the company and saw astronomical returns. Lefkosky cashed out part of his stake early on. $ 120M of the $ 130M Series C round and $ 810M of the $ 950M+ Series D round went to stock redemptions for existing shareholders. Lefkofsky received $ 386M of that amount via two of his investment vehicles, Green Media LLC and 600 West Partners II LLC. What’ s more, he only paid $ 546 in total for those shares, turning literally hundreds of dollars to hundreds of millions in pre-IPO redemptions — and later, billions at IPO. Lefkofsky’ s position as both co-founder and investor <span class="weasel">may</span> sound like an unusual strategy, but “ playing for both sides ” is actually a longstanding practice in Silicon Valley. In the 1990s, it was the model behind the huge success Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers had with the telecommunications company Cerent. When Cisco acquired Cerent in 1999, the $ 6.9B deal was the biggest acquisition ever for a tech company. And for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which invested $ 8M in the company, it resulted in a huge multibillion-dollar payday. Cerent sought investment from a few other firms for its Series C and D rounds — including Norwest Venture Partners, Integral Capital, Advanced Fibre Communication, TeleSoft Partners, and Kinetic Ventures. Meanwhile Cisco invested about $ 13M to acquire 8.2% of the company pre-acquisition. No investor did better, however, than Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, whose 30.8% stake became valued at about $ 2.1B after the stock switch. Notably, Cerent itself was co-founded and led by Kleiner Perkins partner Vinod Khosla. In this, there were parallels to an earlier Kleiner Perkins home run, Genentech. Genentech was co-founded by Robert Swanson, who was also a former Kleiner Perkins partner. Thanks to Kleiner Perkins’ reputation and deal flow, Khosla knew the best engineers in Silicon Valley, and he had a keen awareness of what the market needed. The idea for Cerent practically walked into his office; he just needed to find the right people to execute on it. It started with Raj Singh, who came to Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1996 with an idea for a special Java-specific computer chip. Khosla, who’ d invested in Singh’ s previous company NextGen, was merely “ lukewarm ” to the idea. But he had another idea he wanted to pitch to Singh. “ Mr. Khosla told me there was no money to be made in Java, but we talked about doing a [ optical ] hardware box, ” recalled Singh. Khosla’ s view was that the sharp increase in internet traffic would create a market for a device that <span class="weasel">could</span> handle large amounts of voice and data. Khosla had been able to see, from his experience as a VC and from the <span class="weasel">various</span> companies that came through the Kleiner office, that telecom networks were changing. There was an opportunity to provide a better solution to the problem of connectivity — something cheaper and more flexible that <span class="weasel">could</span> respond to growing demand. What Cerent’ s technology did was help connect long-haul communications lines and the local telephone and data network. This made it faster and easier for phone companies to transmit data. And as the number of internet hosts increased, according to a study by the Internet Systems Consortium, the need for efficient optical network technology did, too. Kleiner Perkins’ 1998 investment marked the beginning of an optical technology bubble, where company valuations skyrocketed and investments flowed. Singh and Khosla staffed out the rest of the company, and within two years, Cisco had purchased them for $ 6.9B. Both Lefkofsky ( with Groupon) and Kleiner Perkins ( with Cerent) were able to win so big in part because they had hands-on operational roles in their investments. By doing so, they were able to expose themselves to much of the upside of their own work. When Snap Inc. went public in March of 2017 at a $ 25B valuation, it was the second-highest valuation at exit of any social media and messaging company since 1999. At the time, the stake held by VC firm Benchmark Capital Partners became worth about $ 3.2B. The IPO also capped a highly productive series of deals for Lightspeed Venture Partners, whose investment of about $ 8M grew to be worth $ 2B. Lightspeed Venture Partners made its first investment in Snap by backing a $ 480K seed round in <span class="weasel">May</span> 2012. Nine months later, Benchmark invested $ 13.5M in the company’ s Series A, as the sole investor in the round. Notably, Benchmark’ s investment <span class="passive">was led</span> by partners Matt Cohler and Mitch Lasky, the latter of whom would become a mentor to Snap founder Evan Spiegel. In part, Lasky was able to build this relationship because of a dispute between Spiegel and Lightspeed, which is not uncommon in the pressure-cooker world of early-stage startups, ambitious founders, and seasoned VCs. Later, in a move reminiscent of Facebook, Snap’ s $ 60M Series B brought a bevy of new investors to the table — among them, General Catalyst, SV Angel, Tencent Holdings, Institutional Venture Partners, and SF Growth Fund. None would see returns as high as Benchmark or Lightspeed. The key to Benchmark’ s success with Snapchat was the firm’ s ability to see beyond the app’ s public perception. Where others saw a fad, it saw a company. As late as 2013, Snapchat was thought of as little more than an app for college students to send each other naked photos. When Bloomberg Businessweek did a feature story on the company early that year, the piece included a GIF “ cover ” showing racy photos that disappeared after a few seconds. While the public and the media were underestimating what Snapchat would become, Mitch Lasky and Benchmark saw something very interesting going on. When they talked to people about the social media they used, they heard Snapchat mentioned in the same breath as companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. After learning more about the company and its founder, Benchmark became convinced that this supposed “ sexting ” app had a bright future. “ At Benchmark we search for entrepreneurs who want to change the world, and Evan and Bobby certainly have that ambition, ” Lasky later wrote on his blog, “ We <span class="weasel">believe</span> that Snapchat can become one of the most important mobile companies in the world, and Snapchat’ s initial momentum — 60 million shared “ snaps ” per day, over 5 billion sent through the service to date — supports that belief. ” “ Snapchat’ s ramp reminded us of another mobile app Benchmark had the good fortune to back at an early stage: Instagram, ” he added. For investors like Mark Suster at Upfront Ventures, the associations with illicit activity were too much to get over. “ I had just seen ( maybe 6 months before) a project called TigerText, ” Suster later wrote on his blog. “ It was a ‘ disappearing text app’ where the founders told me that they named the company because the idea came from how Tiger Woods got caught cheating on his wife because all of his mistresses had evidence that he cheated because they saved text messages from him… That narrative was fresh in my head when I first had the discussion about Snapchat. ” Suster didn’ t want to <span class="weasel">support</span> any app that seemed like its primary audience was cheating husbands. He admits that this was a failure of imagination and a mistake. “ People assume that porn is the first use-case for many new kinds of Internet services, and sometimes it is, ” Susan Etlinger at Altimeter Group told the New York Times. That doesn’ t necessarily mean, however, that it will be the only, or even primary, use case. One of the first successes for Snapchat came when Spiegel realized that the app’ s usage levels were spiking at a small high school in Orange County every weekday between the hours of 8am and 3pm. Spiegel’ s mother had told his cousin, a student at the school, about the app. It had spread from there — the kids were using it, in Spiegel’ s words, as a “ digital version of passing notes in class. ” That was the app that Lasky and Benchmark invested in — not an app for sexting, but one that had undeniable virality and engagement levels even at an early stage. As the examples of Benchmark with Snap and Accel with Facebook show, coming in early with a large offer and actively guiding an investment to success can be a great strategy. As we see from the example of King Digital Entertainment, however, that kind of investment doesn’ t always take a linear path. Activision’ s 2015 acquisition of King Digital Entertainment — the makers of Candy Crush Saga — helped grow the conglomerate company into the largest game network in the world, with over 500M users. The $ 5.9B acquisition price also made the deal a big success for Apax Partners, the buyout firm that owned 44.2% of King Digital at the time. The previous year, King’ s 2014 IPO was hotly anticipated. King set out a <span class="weasel">plan to</span> sell 22.2M shares at a total valuation of $ 7.6B. The company’ s valuation wound up closer to $ 7.1B, at $ 22 per share. Index Ventures, which invested in King in 2005, cashed out shortly afterward, for a return of about $ 560M on its 8% stake. Apax Partners also first invested in King Digital in 2005, when the company was still distressed from a point of near-bankruptcy in 2003. It was still 9 years away from its biggest cash cow game, Candy Crush Saga, and the venture capital market for consumer startups was still in a “ hangover ” from the bursting of the dot-com bubble a few years prior. Due to a combination of these factors, Apax was able to take a huge stake of King Digital, paying <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 36M for 45% ownership in the company. King Digital’ s popularity skyrocketed when the company released Candy Crush Saga in 2012. The app had over 10M downloads by the end of the year. Within two years, it had 97M active daily users. At the time of the company’ s IPO 2014, Apax’ s stake was worth about 100x what it paid in 2005. This made King Apax’ s most successful investment to date. This growth caught the attention of Activision, a large game maker known for games like “ Call of Duty ” and “ Guitar Hero. ” In 2015, Activision approached Apax to ask if the investor would <span class="weasel">consider</span> selling its shares in publicly traded King. However, Apax didn’ t just want to sell: the company saw the potential for a wholesale acquisition of publicly traded King, and its huge 44% stake allowed it to have a <span class="weasel">significant</span> say in the deal. Apax brought King’ s chief executives into its conversation with Activision. The resulting deal happened at a premium to the price at which King had been trading. Apax maximized the return on its investment by taking an active role in negotiating King’ s exit. Alibaba’ s acquisition of UCWeb bears <span class="weasel">some</span> similarities to this deal: one investor ( Alibaba) grew its stake in the company over time and gained a lot of influence. The critical difference is that Alibaba didn’ t sell its investment; rather, this investor acquired the company themselves. Alibaba ‘ s acquisition of mobile browser company UCWeb in 2014 was the largest-ever internet deal in China at the time. The deal valued UCWeb at <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 4.7B — and additionally played a role in helping Alibaba find its feet in mobile and propel its valuation from $ 80B to $ 230B+, a 3x increase. Prior to the deal, UCWeb CEO Yu Yongfu had famously proclaimed that, despite <span class="weasel">significant</span> interest, UCWeb would never sell. It took years of effort by Alibaba founder and CEO Jack Ma to change that. Over the course of 6 years, from 2008 to 2014, Alibaba built a relationship with UCWeb by strategically investing hundreds of millions of dollars and ultimately accumulating a 66% stake in the company. In the end, this relationship paid off in spades. UCWeb’ s earliest VC investors were Morningside Ventures and Ceyuan Ventures, who collectively put $ 10M into the company in its Series A back in 2007. At the time, UCWeb had already been working on mobile browsing for a few years, but was generating no revenue from <span class="weasel">various</span> consumer mobile implementations. In addition, UCWeb was white-labeling custom mobile browsers and doing consulting for Chinese telecommunications companies. Yongfu made the decision to sell the profitable B2B unit, to allow the company to focus more strictly on consumer technology. To do that fully, UCWeb needed investment. In 2008, Jack Ma and Yu Yongfu met for the first time. Alibaba first invested soon afterward, participating in the company’ s $ 12M Series B in 2009. In March 2013, Alibaba made another investment of about $ 506M in the company — and in December 2013, invested $ 180M more, in a deal that gave Alibaba a 66% stake in the company. Rumors soon arose that Morningside wanted out, with Chinese search giant Baidu was looking to buy up its shares. Yu Yongfu told the media that despite rumors, UCWeb had no interest in selling the business. He rejected the offer from Baidu that reportedly would have valued the company at about $ 800M, instead insisting that UCWeb would acquire other businesses. Nevertheless, by 2014, Alibaba would come to own two-thirds of the mobile browsing company now considered “ one of the last good acquisition targets ” in China, and Ma had scored a board seat. “ Jack Ma has, of all people, one of the best high-level strategic views of the industry, ” Yongfu told The Next Web at the time. A few months later, Ma made an offer to buy the company outright, and two months after that, the deal <span class="passive">was finalized</span>. When asked why he was selling now, after years of naysaying, Yongfu told reporters that he trusted Ma: “ We share the same vision and the same dream together. ” The acquisition was a strong strategic move for Alibaba, which at the time of its IPO had made it clear that the rise of mobile was something it needed to reckon with as a business. If it <span class="weasel">could</span> not adapt, Alibaba would be overtaken by companies with stronger mobile offerings, such as Tencent ( owner of WeChat) and Baidu. The acquisition UCWeb was also especially powerful in cutting off a profitable line of business for Baidu, who had previously benefitted from being the default search engine on the UCWeb mobile browser. Finally, the acquisition also seemed to help prove to investors in Alibaba’ s upcoming IPO that the company knew its own shortcomings and was working aggressively to shore them up. While the UCWeb acquisition wasn’ t the only factor at play, Alibaba’ s valuation did soar from $ 35B in 2012 to $ 168B in its 2014 IPO. By 2015, UCWeb ( now owned by Alibaba) was still on top of the mobile browsing market by a healthy margin. Crucial to Alibaba’ s success in acquiring UCWeb was the fact that Jack Ma had become a trusted partner that had worked with the company for 6 years. This was someone who had believed in UCWeb from the beginning, and not just since the company gained traction. It was also someone who knew the work involved in building a company in an emerging market, and who had done it himself with Alibaba. In 2014, Alibaba sold $ 22B of stock in what was, and still is, the biggest IPO on record. Fourteen years earlier in 2000, Japanese telecom giant SoftBank had invested $ 20M for 34% of Alibaba. While its IPO was initially valued at $ 167.6B, its public market debut gave Alibaba a market cap of $ 231B — and valued SoftBank’ s stake in the company at well over $ 60B. Alibaba was pre-revenue and pre-business model when Softbank invested. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’ s founder, made the decision to invest because he knew the internet was about to transform China, as it had already transformed Japan and the United States. He met with 20 prospective Chinese internet entrepreneurs in 1999, ultimately picking one to invest in. His name was Jack Ma. Alibaba in the early days. At bottom, founder and CEO Jack Ma. Source: Entrepreneur “ We didn’ t talk about revenue, we didn’ t even talk about a business model, we just talked about a shared vision, ” Ma would later say. “ I invested based on my sense of smell, ” said Son. By 1999, Son and Softbank had already made two big investments in the internet. Both companies had been huge successes: By 2000, Yahoo! was the effective “ front door of the Internet ” for most Americans. Son wanted to make sure he had an early stake in the Chinese internet. When Ma and Son first met a few years prior to the investment in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan was growing quickly. Ma, inspired, started working on his own web portal for the Chinese market. From 1999 to 2000, the internet-using population of China more than doubled from about 8.9M to 22.5M. In 2000, Son rediscovered Alibaba during the above-mentioned scouting trip in China and officially put his <span class="weasel">support</span> behind Ma’ s project. Fourteen years later, Alibaba’ s IPO prospectus listed SoftBank as the biggest shareholder with a 34.1% stake. This made Son incredibly wealthy — today, he is Japan’ s richest man, with a net worth of $ 21.6B. Forbes says that the dot-com crash in 2000 “ wiped 99% off of SoftBank’ s market cap and close to 90% ” off Son’ s net worth. Fortunately, his stake in Alibaba has done alright since then — today it would be worth $ 130B. The value of the Alibaba stake allowed Son to keep taking out debt to finance Softbank’ s operations ( and acquisitions), arguing that “ SoftBank is a goose that eats debt in order to lay golden eggs. ” Today, Softbank Group is arguably the world’ s biggest investor in private companies, thanks to its $ 93B Vision Fund ( which is also backed by deep-pocketed investors like Saudi Arabia and Apple). Alibaba rode the first wave of the growing Chinese e-commerce market. To onlookers, its success signaled huge market potential. Soon other entrepreneurs and other investors wanted a piece of the pie. <span class="weasel">Some</span> time later, the venture firm Capital Today put its <span class="weasel">support</span> behind a new Chinese e-commerce company: JD.com. In 2006, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, Richard Liu, sought a $ 2M investment to shore up his company’ s finances. To do so, he turned to the Chinese private equity firm Capital Today. Instead, Capital Today decided to invest $ 10M. The decision to invest 5x as much as Liu was asking for proved to be a smart move. When JD.com went public in 2014, that stake was worth $ 2.4B. In the years following Capital Today’ s initial investment, Chinese e-commerce exploded — and many other firms began to take notice of JD.com. Walmart participated in a $ 1.5B round to the company in 2011. Later, the retail giant sold its entire e-commerce operations in China to JD.com. By February 2017, Walmart’ s stake in JD.com reached 12%. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board also invested, participating in a $ 400M private equity round in November 2012. After JD.com went public, the value of those holdings increased to $ 630M. For its part, Capital Today succeeded by investing in a tiny upstart in a market that had just lost a giant incumbent. In 2006, eBay had just fled China, after competitor Taobao had taken over the market after a very expensive battle. Following the Taobao vs. eBay battle was a decade of steady, 25% + annual growth in the Chinese e-commerce industry, and a huge win for JD.com’ s investors. The growth of Chinese e-commerce from 2007 to 2015. Sales grew from 56B yuan to 500B yuan in just the four years starting from 2007. Source: Statista By 2006, however, JD.com’ s money was running low as the company sought to gain its footing in the bruising local e-commerce market. Even so, JD.com’ s cash-strapped chairman and chief executive Richard Liu wanted to expand the company’ s offerings and build new software. That was when he approached Capital Today, pitched his vision of a “ full-service online retailer, ” with a focus on logistics, and asked for $ 2M. Capital Today invested $ 10M, seeing that an internet giant-sized hole had just opened up in the Chinese e-commerce market. JD.com didn’ t need to destroy Alibaba and Taobao; it <span class="weasel">could</span> take only a small percentage of the market and generate a huge return. The investor’ s faith in the company and the market paid off. Today, JD.com continues to grow and take a greater share of the B2C online shopping market in China. Though JD.com and Alibaba are still technically competitors, they are both growing and trying to capture different niches. Of course, sometimes startups and investors stand to gain more if they sell to more dominant competitors. This is what happened when Delivery Hero and Foodpanda butted heads. Delivery Hero won out, but the investors in Foodpanda got a nice consolation prize. The European takeout service Delivery Hero went public in 2017 at a valuation of $ 5.1B. It was a big moment for one of Delivery Hero’ s former rivals and biggest investors, Rocket Internet, who acquired a 30% stake in the company two years prior, in 2015. That stake cost it <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 560M, making for a nearly 3x paper return on its investment. There were plenty of earlier investors in Delivery Hero, including Holtzbrinck and Team Europe as well as Point Nine Capital, WestTech Ventures, Kite Ventures, and ru-Net, among others. Interestingly, “ startup studio ” Rocket Internet and Delivery Hero had been rivals once. Rocket had backed a company called Foodpanda that competed with Delivery Hero in the food takeout space. In late 2016, Rocket sold Foodpanda to Delivery Hero, its former rival. The sale <span class="passive">was funded</span> by issuing new shares of Delivery Hero to Rocket, increasing its stake to that of 37%. This later translated to a 7.5x return on its money by selling the struggling company to the stronger one. Instead of competing with Delivery Hero in the crowded food delivery market, Foodpanda was able to join forces with the company — like Uber and Didi Chuxing did in China — to get a bigger win together. The merger gave Delivery Hero a dominant worldwide position in the takeaway industry. In 2017, Delivery Hero has seen growth across all regions, with revenue in Europe growing 44% in Q1’ 17. That success suggests a new model for international companies. When you try to expand one company across the globe, it can set you up to fight a continual series of guerrilla battles with local competitors. You <span class="weasel">may</span> have higher odds bringing together many smaller companies with tight, regional network effects. Rocket — a publicly traded holding company in Germany run by the Samwer Brothers — has cloned US businesses across many categories and across the globe. The company has found success by thinking about the bigger strategic picture and being able to concede defeat in one battle in pursuit of maximizing returns where it counts, simply in terms of dollars invested. Not from an ego boost that <span class="weasel">might</span> come from “ winning a market. ” This approach has let Rocket Internet achieve huge returns even in spaces where it’ s lost market share to competitors. As tech entrepreneurship takes hold across China, India, and the rest of Asia, in addition to Europe, Rocket Internet has seen big wins balance out its losses. Consolidation across different regions and countries can generate big wins for companies, as well as offering more value to customers. This is exactly what Zayo did with another niche but burgeoning market: local fiber optics providers. The American fiber carrier Zayo ‘ s IPO in 2014 represented a huge turnaround for the fiber optics industry. The company exited at a valuation of $ 4.5B — an encouraging public offering in an industry that had been lagging in the previous decade. That made lead investor Columbia Capital ‘ s stake in 11.4% of the company about $ 500M. Zayo’ s primary value proposition was how well the company was able to aggregate the offerings of different fiber providers. At the time, the American fiber optics market was made up of regional players. Many had their growth stunted by the 2000s dot-com boom and bust. They <span class="passive">were fragmented</span> and mostly undifferentiated. Zayo came in and began consolidating the industry. It raised aggressively to acquire other fiber network and infrastructure companies, buying a total of 32 companies by the time of its IPO. More than five firms invested in Zayo’ s $ 225M Series A in 2007, and among them were Oak Investment Partners, Battery Ventures, and Columbia Capital. This was just as the optical networking market was beginning to recover from a post dot-com slump. The need for bandwidth ( from corporations and homes alike) was increasing rapidly, but most of the companies building out that bandwidth infrastructure were small, straggling, and local. This created what Zayo called “ fiber orphans ” — regional fiber networks, disconnected from their neighbors, that couldn’ t offer value across their borders. Zayo set out to buy and unite them. Zayo <span class="weasel">could</span> take advantage of low prices on companies that had been overbuilt and needed to sell, while remaining confident that there would be a need for its services in the years to come. Bandwidth needs historically have grown at anywhere from 50% to 100% annually, after all, for many organizations. Zayo capitalized on geographic opportunity. It identified a fragmented space and saw that companies were offering similar services. Then it consolidated those efforts and collected the returns. Sometimes it pays to enter a crowded space, if a company has the means to buy up weak players, expand, and execute better than the companies that are already there. In another part of the world, Mobileye and its investors were able to make history by recognizing another type of geographic opportunity. But instead of consolidating a crowded space, it started building where no one else was looking. Mobileye was one of the first companies to recognize the future in autonomous driving. The company started building self-driving car technology 10 years before Google launched its self-driving efforts in 2009. Mobileye went public in 2014 at a $ 5.3B valuation. In 2017, amid mounting pressure from companies like Google and Uber, <span class="weasel">some</span> predicted the company’ s share price would soon correct — instead, it <span class="passive">was acquired</span> by Intel for $ 15.3B. The company’ s backers included <span class="weasel">several</span> Israeli investors. In 2003, Mobileye raised $ 15M from <span class="weasel">various</span> Israeli entrepreneurs and VCs, including FIBI Holding, Motorola Solutions Venture Capital, Colmobil Group, Lev Levayev, Delek Motors, Solid Investment Bank, Eldan, and Ari Steimatzky. Colmobil was the only shareholder not to sell any shares after IPO — its 7.2% stake became worth about $ 1B at acquisition. The company’ s biggest US financial investor, Goldman Sachs, put about $ 100M into the company back in 2007, instantly giving <span class="weasel">some</span> early investors in the company a tenfold return. Goldman then took an <span class="weasel">approximately</span> 12.3% stake and sold nearly all of it when the company went public. Despite coming to Mobileye significantly later than many of its Israeli VC counterparts, Goldman was still able to make a 10x return on its investment. And it did so by going outside the traditional hubs of startup investing and making a bold bet. Historically, Jerusalem hasn’ t been much of a hub of startup or venture activity— even within Israel. Even today, Tel Aviv <span class="passive">is considered</span> the “ real ” place to build a startup in Israel. Mobileye, however, began its life in Jerusalem. Despite its reputation relative to Tel Aviv, the city of Jerusalem was actually a highly fertile place for a high-tech company like Mobileye to emerge from back in 2007. Jerusalem is home to Hebrew University, one of the top-ranked universities for math and computer science in the world. It has a highly skilled immigration population from Russia and elsewhere, which gave Mobileye a natural pool of talented engineers to pull early employees from. And it was a professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering who would go on to start the company: Amnon Shashua, who also studied machine learning at the university, would co-found and serve as CTO of the $ 15.3B company. Ziv Aviram, his co-founder, studied industrial engineering and management and was known for leading Israeli retail companies. “ During that period, Jerusalem had more resources than anywhere else in Israel – academia, a high-quality population, more funds and multinational corporations such as Teva and Intel. It was fertile ground for the high-tech and startup industry, ” Israeli entrepreneur Elie Wurtman told Haaretz in 2016. Tel Aviv <span class="weasel">may</span> be the traditional “ tech center ” of Israel, but there were always good reasons for discriminating VCs to look to Jerusalem as well — the lower rents, easy access to a top university in Hebrew University, a highly skilled immigrant population, as well as government tax incentives. Entrepreneur Magazine named it as one of the top 5 places outside Silicon Valley to start a company in 2015. But geopolitical and economic circumstances made it difficult for Mobileye to raise traditional venture backing. Mobileye <span class="passive">was founded</span> in 1999, right before the Palestinian uprising from 2000 – 2005 and the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2002. Mobileye weathered the harsh startup climate, and by 2013, had a $ 1.5B valuation. Today, Jerusalem’ s startup scene is growing quickly, and Mobileye’ s IPO and subsequent sale to Intel will only accelerate it, as it is leaving billions in the pocket of founders and employees. As has happened in countless fledgling startup hubs <span class="weasel">around</span> the world, those fortunate employees — restless, experienced, and hungry — now have the dry powder to go start their own companies and make their own investments. Companies with experienced founders already have a leg up. And as Semiconductor Manufacturing International ( SMIC) has shown, when those founders have a chance to thrive in a needy market, they can knock it out of the park. Dick Kramlich’ s partners at New Enterprise Associates told him he was crazy when he recommended they invest $ 100M into Semiconductor Manufacturing International ( SMIC), a Chinese semiconductor chip maker. After SMIC raised $ 1.7B in its 2004 IPO, however, the deal made NEA many multiples in returns. Kramlich and NEA got those returns by investing in the Chinese technology market when no other Silicon Valley VCs were taking it seriously. In 2003, SMIC raised a $ 630M Series C that included NEA, Oak Investment Partners and Walden International, in addition to a lineup of mainly international firms: Vertex Ventures Israel, Temasek Holdings, H & Q Asia Pacific, Beida Microelectronics Investment, and Shanghai Industrial Holdings. At the time, China had just recently opened its semiconductor industry to foreign investment, and most US investors had no idea what to expect. It <span class="passive">was uncharted</span> territory. There were no definite models to reference and plenty of what Kramlich’ s partners called “ geopolitical risks. ” Kramlich, however, insisted SMIC was a worthwhile investment. First, there was China’ s growth rate to <span class="weasel">consider</span>. Even as it slowed down during the late 1990s, it held steady at about 7% or 8%. The US, for reference, grows at an average of about 3.22% per year. Second, China was ( at the time) consuming more semiconductors than any other country on earth. Its rate of semiconductor consumption was growing at 24.8% per year compared to a worldwide average of 3.8%. Third, the team behind SMIC was made of semiconductor industry veterans from other Asian countries. They’ d already built successful semiconductor businesses in Korea and elsewhere, and now it was finally possible to invest in them. The stars <span class="passive">were aligned</span>: Kramlich and NEA saw this when they flew over to China for due diligence in 2002. Soon after, NEA signed for a $ 90M investment. Then, in 2003, the firm invested another $ 30M, for a total of $ 120M before SMIC’ s IPO. By 2007, NEA had invested about $ 300M overall in bets on Chinese companies. NEA’ s success goes to show that the biggest opportunities are often found in risky places. When other investors <span class="passive">are scared</span>, that’ s precisely when you <span class="weasel">should</span> be doing your research and preparing your own move. Knowledge of a local market’ s nuances is precisely what led Sinovation Ventures to our next big VC deal — Meitu. The 2016 IPO of Meitu, a Chinese photo editing app, was the largest IPO in Hong Kong in over a decade. The company <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 4.9B and raised $ 630M in the public offering. This marked a milestone for the Chinese technology market — and for early investor Sinovation Ventures, which saw up to 40x returns on its investments in the app. Sinovation led the company’ s Series A in 2013. In 2014, the investor <span class="passive">was joined</span> by Qiming Venture Partners in Meitu’ s $ 10M Series B round. What made Meitu a strong investment was that it wasn’ t just a copycat. Investor fear of missing out ( FOMO) tends to <span class="weasel">drive</span> over-investment in “ me-too ” ideas in other markets. Having missed successes like Groupon in the US, investors will go hunting for a perfect copy overseas. These overseas investors tend to miss the local nuance <span class="weasel">around</span> what it takes to make a product sticky and successful. Meitu wasn’ t simply a photo editing or “ face-tuning ” app. Meitu rode in the very unique slipstream of two huge forces in Chinese culture. First, there was mobile. Right <span class="weasel">around</span> the launch of the Meitu mobile app, smartphone usage in China started to grow exponentially. That gave the app an organic engine for growth. Second, there was a growing obsession with beauty. <span class="weasel">Around</span> the time Meitu launched, China had a very low plastic surgery procedure per capita rate compared to its neighbors. By 2014, 7M Chinese people were traveling outside the country to get work done. Investor funding helped Meitu to expand on the back of photo retouching. It now has 20+ products. Meitu Inc’ s six flagship apps are Meitu, BeautyCam, Meipai, Beauty Plus, SelfieCity, and MakeupPlus. They routinely fill the leaderboard in the Chinese app store. As of October 2016, China Tech Insights reported that there were 456M users across all of Meitu, Inc.’ s apps. There are <span class="weasel">significant</span> users bases spanning <span class="weasel">several</span> countries in Asia, including China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand. The lesson here is to look at local markets and understand what will make a certain product sticky. Copycat companies only understand the idea for the company — context-specific companies can actually nail the execution. With both Meitu and Semiconductor Manufacturing International, we saw context-specific companies that grew fast amidst bigger macroeconomic shifts in China. Whether it was opening up to foreign investment or the growth of smartphones, these companies rode larger waves to success. Riding big waves is how many of the biggest companies on this list got to where they are. Those waves aren’ t always visible from the outset, though, and they’ re not without their abrupt breaks. In 2000, the entire market for internet startups suffered in the dot-com crash. If you’ d invested in Google’ s Series A, the value of your investment would have taken a nosedive. It would have taken a lot of confidence in the underlying technology to stay with the company, but for the VC firms that had it, staying on meant a huge return. In 1999, Google raised a Series B round of $ 12.5M each from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital. A year after Google’ s IPO in 2004, those investors’ stakes were worth about $ 4.3B each — a 300x return. It took real conviction in the potential of Google to get Kleiner and Sequoia through the market turmoil that came between initial investment and IPO. Between 1999 and 2004, $ 1.8T in market value was lost in the crash — NASDAQ lost half of its entire value in 2001 alone. Kleiner invested in Google in 1999 and the company would launch its initial offering in 2004. During that time, the Nasdaq index reached peak height and then fell sharply. Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia held on through the turbulence, and even through Google’ s IPO, when tech stocks were worth a quarter of what they’ d been worth. By 2004, Google had grown into a company that was worth $ 23B — absolutely astronomical at the time. Part of the terms of the Series A investments for both Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia was that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin bring in an external CEO to run the company. When Page and Brin tried to backtrack on hiring a CEO for “ adult supervision, ” Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr almost backed out and sold off his firm’ s shares. But ultimately, Doerr chose to stick <span class="weasel">around</span>, and instead convinced Page and Brin they needed a CEO — by asking if he <span class="weasel">could</span> introduce them to successful CEOs to understand what the job demanded. After meeting Steve Jobs, Andy Grove, Scott Cook, and Jeff Bezos, the Google co-founders decided that they also wanted to hire an external CEO. Doerr introduced them to Eric Schmidt, and in 2001 Schmidt <span class="passive">was hired</span> as Google’ s first external CEO. Under Schmidt, revenue grew to $ 1.42B by the time of the IPO and to over $ 30B by the time Page replaced Schmidt as CEO in 2011. In later years, founders of other startups began rebelling against getting replaced by professional CEOs and executives. But it was critical that Doerr convinced two incredibly independent founders to bring in an experienced hand. Ultimately, Schmidt’ s insight was absolutely essential in navigating the company through the dot-com crash, the most traumatic time in the internet’ s history, as well as subsequent growing pains. Investors like Doerr at Kleiner Perkins invest in theses. They don’ t just <span class="weasel">believe</span> that certain companies are going to be successful — they’ ve developed specific beliefs about why those companies will succeed, and this helps them hang on when others <span class="weasel">might</span> get out. These principles have also been particularly important to Union Square Ventures in many of its investments. It beat out <span class="weasel">several</span> other companies for an early investment in Twitter — all because the Twitter founders believed in USV’ s investment philosophy. Twitter ‘ s IPO raised $ 1.8B in 2013, valuing the company at about $ 14.2B. And thanks to a Series A investment, Union Square Ventures’ share of Twitter <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 863M. While many different VCs ( CRV, Kleiner Perkins, Benchmark, Insight Venture Partners) would join the later funding rounds for the early social media network, USV was able to get in early, leading the company’ s $ 5M Series A in 2007. USV beat out four other VC firms for the opportunity to invest largely because of its investment thesis. Founders Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham first decided in 2003 that their firm would “ have a thesis, stick to it, and evolve it. ” They would strictly set out how each fund’ s money was spent — no money would be put in a company or sector that didn’ t fit the thesis. And, importantly, they would write about it publicly. USV’ s early blog contained its partners’ takes on all kinds of companies and where the internet <span class="weasel">might</span> be going. When the young USV analyst Charlie O’ Donnell got obsessed with Twitter while attending SXSW in 2006, the rest of the firm did too, and Wilson ended up writing a post about it. Meanwhile, Twitter was suddenly explosively popular and its infrastructure couldn’ t handle it. The company had about 250,000 active users and a growing reputation as one of the most unique social networks out there. Presidential candidate John Edwards was tweeting from the campaign trail, and there were fake Bill Clinton and Darth Vader accounts. Local police stations and fire stations were tweeting. But the service kept on buckling under the strain. The Twitter “ fail whale ” screen, featuring a whale held aloft by blue songbirds, appeared whenever the network was out of commission. The screen became well-known as a sign that Twitter was having serious scaling problems. The Twitter team needed to raise money to hire engineers and fix their infrastructure. Co-founders Jack Dorsey and Ev Williams knew they were going to go with USV, because they’ d already read about USV’ s vision for Twitter on Wilson’ s blog, AVC. In April 2007, Wilson wrote a post where said he saw Twitter as the “ status broadcasting system of the internet. ” The web doesn’ t have one yet, he wrote, and so Twitter “ is going to be it. ” It would thereby join companies like Amazon, eBay, and Facebook as one of the crucial services across the modern web stack. Since they were in agreement on the central thesis, they <span class="weasel">could</span> also agree that both revenue, and a business model, <span class="weasel">could</span> be figured out later. Wilson had already written about figuring out a business model “ along the way ” when he blogged about USV’ s investment in del.icio.us. He later used <span class="weasel">some</span> of the same language to explain the firm’ s investment in Twitter: “ As we stated when we made our investment in Delicious, the question everyone asks is ‘ What is the business model?’ To be completely and totally honest, we don’ t yet know. The capital we are investing will go to making Twitter a better, more reliable and <span class="weasel">robust</span> service. That’ s where the focus needs to be right now. We’ ll have plenty of time to figure out the business model and there are many options to choose from. ” Many VCs had already pulled out of potential deals into Twitter, citing the lack of revenue and lack of any <span class="weasel">plan to</span> get to revenue. Negotiations for a possible acquisition by Yahoo! fell apart over the meager offer made — $ 12M — and so the need to fix the service’ s uptime problems eventually brought Dorsey and company <span class="weasel">around</span> to USV. USV understood Twitter’ s desires so well that when Dorsey defended the idea of Twitter during those acquisition talks with Yahoo!, he used Wilson’ s own language to do it. From Hatching Twitter: “ I see Twitter as a utility, ” Jack said in one meeting with Yahoo!. “ A broadcasting system for the Internet. ” Then he began to describe his vision for Twitter, noting that it was “ like electricity. ” While Twitter confused Yahoo! and most VCs, it did not confuse USV. The firm made that abundantly clear on its blog, and when Twitter wanted to raise money, it came knocking. Founders don’ t have an indefinite amount of time to raise money. To the extent that a VC can make its underlying beliefs about the future and its investing thesis clear, it can <span class="weasel">encourage</span> deal flow from a stronger, more self-selecting group of founders who are confident they’ re teaming up with the right investor. But a thesis doesn’ t just help founders find you, it works the other way as well, as a lens that helps firms spot opportunities. For USV, it helps the firm find companies that the investors <span class="weasel">believe</span> are growing along successful trajectories. Zynga — and its historically massive IPO — is the perfect case in point. Zynga ‘ s $ 7B IPO in 2011 made social gaming history — and was an important moment for Union Square Ventures, a Zynga investor, which owned a 5.1% stake worth $ 285.1M when the company went public. USV’ s success with Twitter was about identifying a nascent network and recognizing that powerful and fast-growing networks like Facebook <span class="weasel">could</span> create equally, if not more profitable companies that grew atop their platforms. Zynga was less than a year old when USV led its $ 10M Series A round in 2008. It <span class="passive">was joined</span> on the deal by Avalon Ventures, Foundry Group, and Clarium Capital, as well as by angels like Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel, among others. At this point, it was still early for the “ platform era. ” The idea of building on top of existing social networks wasn’ t a no brainer. But as USV partner Fred Wilson explained, Zynga’ s <span class="weasel">aim</span> to create web-based games on top of social networks was an untapped opportunity. He believed the company <span class="weasel">could</span> quickly scale the game based on the network effects of existing social platforms. This idea grew out of USV’ s investing thesis: Invest in large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience, and defensible through network effects ( the fact that networks become exponentially more valuable and unassailable as they grow larger). “ Building a game network on top of the social web is a big idea, ” wrote Fred Wilson of USV. “ It starts with great games, both real-time like poker and blackjack and turn-based like Scramble. But the most important thing is to plug into the APIs of the <span class="weasel">various</span> social networks so that you can easily find out which of your friends are online and ready to play with you. Doing both well is hard and to date, no company other than Zynga Game Network has done that with multiple games on multiple networks. ” Zynga was in a good position to scale up its network by using data on consumer behavior to increase user engagement. Andrew Trader, one of the founding members of the Zynga team, says that the company’ s focus on metrics is its most important corporate value. Notably, Zynga pioneered event-based analytics to innovate and add sticky features and mechanics to its games. It also built its own internal analytics platform called ZTrack to do the heavy-duty analysis. In addition, it created models for analyzing the performance of games and features before they launched, so that it <span class="weasel">could</span> use the behavioral data it gathered during gameplay to begin iterating immediately. Zynga’ s platform across multiple games meant it <span class="weasel">could</span> collect user behavior across <span class="weasel">several</span> different interfaces and <span class="weasel">encourage</span> users to move from one game to another based on the features and behaviors that were most engaging. Then, it used this data to inform how it monetized customers’ actions in games. Since many Zynga games are free-to-play and involve the purchase of virtual goods with real money, it was incredibly important for the company to figure out what game events and features users would pay to gain access to. It figured this out early by analyzing user data. This helped it to rapidly grow its revenue from virtual goods. Zynga <span class="weasel">could</span> echo the growth of Facebook and build a large, engaged network of its own. TechCrunch reported that Zynga had 1.6M daily active users on Facebook in 2008 and was cash flow positive. This is when other companies and investors started paying attention. This led to a $ 29M Series B led by Kleiner Perkins and Institutional Venture Partners. USV contributed again in this round. Before Zynga went public, USV made $ 26M in share sales. Then it struck gold again in the $ 7B IPO, making for a 75 to 80x return on its money. With Zynga, USV was one of the earliest investors and most steadfast believers in Zynga CEO and founder Mark Pincus. In comparison, USV’ s investment in Lending Club came late. But its decision to invest in a later round with Lending Club provides a model for how a thesis-driven firm must sometimes rewrite its own rulebook. When the marketplace lending startup Lending Club went public in 2014, its IPO was 20x oversubscribed and its stock jumped 56% during its first day of trading. At the time of its exit, Lending Club had amassed many prominent backers. But it also had one investor that you <span class="weasel">might</span> not have expected to see — not because this investor didn’ t invest in networked consumer startups, but because it normally wouldn’ t start investing in a company past the Series A round: Union Square Ventures. Lending Club raised its $ 10.3M Series A in 2007 from Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners. It added Morgenthaler Ventures for its $ 12M Series B two years later, and Foundation Capital for its $ 24.5M Series C a year after that. It wasn’ t until Lending Club’ s $ 25M Series D in 2011 that Union Square Ventures invested. By the time of its IPO, Lending Club’ s $ 5.4B valuation translated to a $ 400M+ return for Union Square Ventures. USV’ s investment in Lending Club is remarkable because it was one of the first times that Union Square Ventures had invested in a late-stage company without having participated in earlier rounds of fundraising. Previously, it’ d limited themselves from considering these companies. It’ d held strong beliefs about investing early and maintaining a large percentage of ownership. A late-stage investment obviously didn’ t allow this. USV had been aware of Lending Club since it was first founded. It’ d built an online, peer-to-peer lending platform. Investors <span class="weasel">could</span> come on Lending Club and lend out money, collecting on the interest, while borrowers <span class="weasel">could</span> get a loan at a lower interest rate than they would from a bank. It <span class="passive">were interested</span> in the idea of peer-to-peer lending, but initially, chose not to invest in the company. The service only seemed to be attracting risky borrowers. Lenders were losing money. There didn’ t seem to be anything special that was keeping users <span class="weasel">around</span>. But later, Lending Club made changes to its business model that brought the company in line with USV’ s thesis focused on network effects. It also opened the door for real growth for Lending Club. In 2011, Fred Wilson and his team decided to invest. When Lending Club changed the rules on how it vetted new borrowers and lowered its overall approval rate on new loans to just 10%, it seemed to open the doors to virtuous cycles. Its investors started to see far better returns. Usage started to grow. Suddenly, there were real network effects to Lending Club. With more good borrowers, you’ d get more good lenders, and the two would, in theory, grow in parallel. USV’ s well-known thesis began to ring true for Lending Club: Large networks of engaged users, differentiated through user experience, and defensible through network effects. USV invested in Lending Club from the Opportunity Fund, which had been set up earlier that year. In a blog post, USV explained that its Opportunity Fund would allow it to invest more in its current portfolio companies in later rounds, and to invest in the later rounds of companies that it’ d been following but was unable to invest in sooner. Most investors accustomed to investing at an early stage don’ t want to get in that late. It’ s a lot harder to get solid returns when the first time you invest in a company is during its Series D. But according to Wilson and his team’ s thesis —which Lending Club suddenly fit — it was still the early stages for Lending Club’ s network-fueled growth. It would be very much worth the premium to get in. From the time of USV’ s investment in 2011 to the time of Lending Club’ s IPO in 2014, Lending Club scaled up its lending rate from $ 20M/month in originations to $ 500M/month. In its IPO, it raised $ 870M. Recently, USV invested in other marketplace lenders by backing a new credit startup called Upgrade. It’ s another venture from Lending Club founder Renaud Laplanche. Earlier this year in 2017, USV led Upgrade’ s $ 60M Series A funding round. In a blog post, USV called Upgrade “ Lending Club 2.0 ” and said it <span class="passive">was excited</span> to continue investing in the marketplace lending model. USV’ s thesis has always stayed the same. But a change in circumstances — the company’ s direction and the market’ s maturity — allowed USV to see Lending Club in a new light. By the time it invested in 2011, it knew it was making an investment that it had conviction about. The firmness of conviction <span class="weasel">may</span> sound like a hard-to-quantify feeling, and it is. But it’ s crucial. Conviction helps investors to lean in, and in turn gives more <span class="weasel">support</span> to growing companies. In fact, investor conviction was essential to fueling another company on our list — Genentech. Genentech, a biotech company founded in 1976, made global headlines when it <span class="passive">was acquired</span> by Swiss healthcare company Roche in 2009 for $ 46.8B. As the company’ s very first investor, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers received what now-deceased founding partner Tom Perkins once called “ one of the largest payoffs in history. ” Through his relentless effort to make Genentech a success, Perkins himself created a new mold for the entrepreneurial venture capitalist. In 1976, when Perkins led the firm’ s investment in Genentech, there was barely any “ biotech ” industry to speak of. With no expertise in the subject himself, Perkins had to teach himself the basics. Then he had to vet and doggedly nurture one of the most unusual companies to ever hit Silicon Valley. All along, he considered it highly <span class="weasel">likely</span> the investment would be a total loss for the firm. And yet, in the end, he felt it had gone perfectly: “ I honestly think that if we had to do it all over again, we’ d do it the same way, ” he said, “ I don’ t think we made a single strategic error. ” In the mid-1970s, there was skepticism in both the scientific and VC communities on the commercial feasibility of genetic engineering, Genentech’ s main focus. Today, there is no such skepticism. And the wider biotech sector drives hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year. Perkins saw market potential for an emerging scientific field. And instead of relying on validation from other investors or companies, Perkins proactively sought out scientific advice from specialized researchers and used that to inform his investment decisions. In doing this, he was able to help facilitate the growth of a company that everyone wrote off. Genentech <span class="passive">was started</span> in 1976 by Herbert Boyer, PhD, and Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist and former investor at Kleiner Perkins. Both believed the new technology of recombinant DNA <span class="weasel">could</span> be used in a mass-market therapy. But common scientific and business opinion at this time said this technology was 10 to 15 years away. Boyer and Swanson began working together in April and funded their project with $ 500 each. After living on unemployment and a shoestring for a few months, they sought out investment capital. The two brought an 8-page business proposal to Swanson’ s former boss, Tom Perkins. According to an article from the Wharton School, Perkins did his research before making what <span class="weasel">might</span> have seemed like a crackpot investment. He identified two technical questions that he felt underpinned the potential success of the company. Then he submitted these questions out to specialized researchers, and didn’ t commit his $ 250K investment until he received positive results. That began a long history between Perkins and Genentech. Perkins eventually went on to serve as Genentech’ s chairman. The New York Times reports that he has called Genentech his favorite investment. Media outlets like Fast Company have cited Perkins’ investment in Genentech as evidence of the firm’ s “ uncanny knack for signaling out the next big thing ( s). ” But this overlooks a key detail of the investment: the fact that Perkins nurtured the company’ s unlikely vision from the firm’ s very beginning and helped it to become the success that it was. It also ignores Tom Perkins’ own hands-on work as chairman of Genentech. Perkins was known as a pioneer in the movement for VCs to take larger hands-on management roles in their portfolio companies. According to the Financial Times, Perkins’ other founding partners at KPCB, Frank Caufield and Brook Byers, said: “ He defined what we know of today as entrepreneurial venture capital by going beyond just funding to helping entrepreneurs realize their visions with operating expertise. ” One thing that hasn’ t changed since Kleiner’ s investment in Genentech is the general reluctance, among many Sand Hill Road VCs, to invest in biotech. Unless, that is, the entrepreneurs involved can make their biotech company look like a software startup. That’ s exactly how Stemcentrx helped Founders Fund make its first biotech investment its biggest exit ever. In April 2016, the drug company AbbVie paid $ 1.9B in cash and $ 3B in stock to buy Stemcentrx, a small biotech startup. About $ 1.7B of that <span class="passive">was reported</span> to go directly to the company’ s largest individual investor, Founders Fund, which invested about $ 200M in total into Stemcentrx. At the time of the AbbVie deal, the company reached a $ 10.2B valuation. Stemcentrx also saw investment from a variety of other investors, many of whom ( like Founders Fund) tend not to invest in biotech — among them Elon Musk and Sequoia Capital. Fidelity led the $ 250M Series G round in 2015. For Founders Fund, however, this was one of the biggest investments the fund had ever made in a single company. That’ s all the more notable due to the fact that Founders Fund is famous for looking for investments in companies and industries other VCs deem too risky. Biotech is a notoriously risky industry, arguably more so than software. In software, code is always broken for a reason. If you figure out the error, you can make it work again. With human biology, there’ s so much we simply don’ t know that your entire project <span class="weasel">could</span> be doomed without your knowledge. You can put out a minimal viable product of most any software product after a few months and start iterating based on customer feedback. In biotech, you get one shot to make your product work, and you can never fully eliminate the risk that it will simply fail in clinical trials. That’ s especially true in the development of cancer drugs, which are more difficult to test than others due to the scarcity of quality cell lines. In 2013, a paper in Oral Oncology had to be retracted after it <span class="passive">was discovered</span> that the widely used line of cancer cells in the study had been entirely contaminated by HeLa cells. Those cells ( known as HeLa because they originated, infamously, in the body of Henrietta Lacks) <span class="passive">were used</span> for experiments across the globe before they started proliferating and “ taking over ” other cells used to study disease. All <span class="weasel">around</span> the world, trials have had to be retracted and retraced after discovering contamination in the cancer cells <span class="passive">being used</span> for experiments. For a VC who invests primarily in software, this kind of randomness presents a massive risk. A software startup relies only on code ( deterministic, clear) and developing an audience. Over the long term, it can provide unmatched returns on capital. A biotech company can too, but it requires more capital upfront — and there’ s a high possibility that it will all turn to smoke even with a brilliant team and a brilliant idea. “ You have to get through basic research, preclinical, Phase I, II, and III, and then marketing. So approaching it analytically, the question is how do you discount [ the risk of failure at each step ]. If you do half on each step, and there are six steps, that’ s 2 to the 6th, or 64. So something worth a billion at the end means you start at [ a value of ] $ 16 million. “ The thing I don’ t like about this as an investor is that the numbers are totally arbitrary. They are just made-up numbers. And our feeling with many biotechs is that people understate these probabilities. They say it’ s half, but maybe it’ s just one in 10. And even if just one of these steps is one in 10, you are really screwed. I would be very nervous to invest in a company where it gets pitched as a series of contingencies that ‘ this has to work, and this has to work, and this has to work. ' ” — Peter Thiel In Stemcentrx, however, Founders Fund found “ a biotech company that looked like a software company. ” Stemcentrx did everything possible to get rid of those “ probabilistic contingencies. ” It did things like graft cancer cells into live mice — more expensive than studying them in culture, but far more reliable. Studying cells in culture opens you up to risk that you’ re going to discover that you’ re working with already-mutated, contaminated cells ( like HeLa) without even realizing it. While it’ s more difficult and requires more work upfront to graft cancer into mice, it’ s far more <span class="weasel">likely</span> to generate results that can be extrapolated to humans. Still not anywhere near perfect — but better. The key, for Founders Fund, was seeing that Stemcentrx <span class="passive">was devoted</span> to reducing contingencies. Brian Singerman, who led the investment, outsourced <span class="weasel">some</span> of the due diligence on Stemcentrx to <span class="weasel">various</span> biotech experts to ensure Founders Fund wasn’ t being taken. He needed someone with experience to explain whether what Stemcentrx was doing <span class="weasel">could</span> really be a success. When he did, they came back asking if they <span class="weasel">could</span> invest in the company. Founders Fund had started out with the same trepidations about biotech that every other investor in Silicon Valley had. It was able to overcome those trepidations by finding a biotech company that acted as if it was a Silicon Valley startup. It went hunting for de-risked investments in a land full of risk — and it found one. While firms like Founders Fund tend to follow a strategy of finding great companies and allowing them to operate unimpeded, that’ s not the only path to success. With Workday, Greylock Partners was about as far from a hands-off partner as you <span class="weasel">could</span> have. That’ s because the company was actually founded by a partner — one Aneel Bhusri. Workday ‘ s $ 637M raise at IPO in 2012 was the highest priced venture-backed public offering since Facebook’ s. Unlike Facebook, however, which shrunk once exposed to the public markets, Workday’ s stock soared from a starting point of $ 28 per share to about $ 50 a share on its first day of trading. For Greylock Partners, that meant turning an investment of about $ 80M into over $ 700M for a total 9x return. The confluence between company and VC was strong in this case. Workday co-founder Aneel Bhusri, who was also a senior partner at Greylock, had noticed a huge transformation emerging in consumer technology. He started Workday, in part, as a bet on the idea that the same transformation would be coming to enterprise technology. Bhusri’ s main thesis was that it was becoming increasingly important to build applications with great user interfaces. There were so many options for software out there ( and with the cloud, virtually limitless possibilities) that the user experience had to be good. Faced with the choice between a piece of software people wanted to use and one they didn’ t — other things being equal — hiring managers would choose the former. “ From the early days we thought of ourselves as a consumer internet technology company from the underlying technologies we used, and we build enterprise applications on top of that, ” he said. “ I love to use the analogy that Amazon is a very complex order management system and has a nice user interface. There’ s no training manual for Amazon, why <span class="weasel">should</span> there be a training manual for HR and Finance? ” In human resources and finance, you see many intra-organization users needing to access their tools at key points. They need to check their benefits at the end of the year. They need to update their personal information when they move. Since everyone needs to do these things, Bhusri realized, it <span class="weasel">should</span> be simpler. The same way that products like Facebook and Amazon made previously complicated processes like communicating with friends or buying products off the web simple, Workday would make these HR processes simple. It was a thesis bolstered by <span class="weasel">several</span> high-profile B2C investments that Greylock made in the years leading up to the Workday. Previously, Greylock had focused its investments on companies building core internet infrastructure and B2B companies. It invested in companies innovating on semiconductor design, building out broadband networks, and the sort. Then came 2004, and the consumer internet was in full swing. Friendster was fighting MySpace for social network supremacy. The press <span class="passive">was obsessed</span>. Greylock invested in LinkedIn, which raised its Series B in October 2004. It invested in Wink, which raised its Series A in January 2005; Vudu, which raised its in June; and Digg, which raised its in October. It invested in Facebook, which raised its Series B in April 2006. Each of these companies built products that led with easy to use and clean user interfaces. They were intuitive products that didn’ t require the user to “ figure them out ” the way so much pre-Web 2.0 technology did. In the case of LinkedIn, it demonstrated that you <span class="weasel">could</span> bring the style and ethos of the consumer internet to bear on the “ professional ” sphere. People would use a site that looked like Facebook at work if you told them it was for work. The key to adoption was making something people wanted to use. At Greylock, Bhusri got this insider’ s view on just how these products generated growth — and he <span class="weasel">could</span> apply these insights to Workday. Copying business models of successful US startups and an aggressive operational style helped Rocket Internet build successful internet companies — from Zalando to FoodPanda — and create millions in revenue. But seven years after its formation, Rocket Internet’ s multi-billion dollar IPO was a disappointment. The company had failed to impress public market investors and convince them of its ability to create winners in the future. Rocket Internet’ s 2014 IPO raised over $ 2B for the Berlin-based startup incubator, valuing the company at <span class="weasel">approximately</span> $ 8.49B at the time of the offering. With its public market debut, Rocket Internet was one of Germany’ s biggest tech IPOs since the early 2000s, but was still considered a disappointment. Shares fell nearly 13% to under $ 47 soon after trading started. Shortly before the IPO, chief executive Oliver Samwer talked up Rocket’ s ambitious future claiming “ Alibaba is the model, ” referring to the Chinese giant which had a $ 21.8B IPO earlier that year. Rocket Internet reported the close of its first equity funding in 2013, 6 years after it <span class="passive">was founded</span> by Samwer and his two brothers in Berlin. This $ 500M deal included Access Industries, Holtzbrinck Ventures, and Kinnevik AB — which maintained an approximate 24% ownership stake in the company. In less than two years, Rocket Internet had secured additional infusion of capital from corporate investors — Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company ( PLDTC) and United Internet — which diluted the founders’ and early investors’ ownership share. The Samwer brothers, through their investment arm Global Founders, still held over 50% of Rocket Internet, with Kinnevik and United Internet each controlling over 10% of the company prior to its IPO. By August 2014, the company <span class="passive">was valued</span> at nearly $ 6B. Rocket Internet’ s ownership at the time of IPO. What did Rocket’ s value rest on? The company’ s entire promise <span class="passive">was based</span> on its ability to pick and develop winning startups. In its IPO prospectus, Rocket Internet classified 11 of its portfolio companies as “ proven winners ” and claimed 9 others to be “ emerging stars. ” The “ proven winners, ” or the company’ s largest and most mature companies, featured e-commerce startups operating across the globe like Jabong ( India), Lamoda ( Russia), Linio ( Mexico/LatAm), and Namshi ( UAE), among others. Rocket’ s early success and investor interest in the private market hasn’ t quite carried on to the public market as the stock has fallen dramatically since IPO. In June 2017, one of Rocket Internet’ s biggest early stakeholders —Kinnevik— sold the last of its stake in the company and called Rocket Internet “ one of the best investments Kinnevik has made, ” which yielded an annual 90% internal rate of return and six times its invested capital. Rocket Internet’ s network of companies at the time of IPO. Late-stage investors are allowing tech startups to stay private longer, but Qudian’ s 2017 IPO ( within four years of founding) is a story of a breakthrough product, rapid fund-raising rounds, and a crucial strategic partnership. Qudian capitalized on lack of regulation in the emerging Chinese alternative lending space to dominate market share and was quick to give returns to its private investors by way of an IPO. Qudian ( fka Qufenqi) raised $ 900M in its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2017 and was the biggest public listing for a Chinese fintech company in the United States. The listing <span class="passive">was oversubscribed</span> and was a particularly lucrative exit for its then 34 year-old CEO, Min Luo, who owned about a fifth of the company before it went public. Founded in 2014, Qudian started as an e-commerce shopping site targeted towards university students and young professionals, enabling them to borrow money to buy goods and pay back the loans in monthly installments. In the first half of 2017, Qudian’ s revolving credit model offers credit to 7M young Chinese consumers on a digital platform that <span class="passive">is integrated</span> with Alibaba’ s products. Luo has emphasized that the company targets young consumers — they are given credit for small items without having to go through the hassle of dealing with a bank ( Qudian’ s average cash loan amount was about $ 136 in the same time period). Qudian’ s Credit Approval and Servicing Process. Qudian relies on alternative data sources like the applicant’ s e-commerce data, mobile phone records, and social media network to check for creditworthiness. The company launched with backing from <span class="weasel">various</span> China-based angel investors. Within 10 months, Qudian raised three rounds of funding from BlueRun Ventures and other investors. The Series B in August 2014 valued Qudian at over $ 162M, and a $ 100M Series C round that December led by BlueRun pushed the startup’ s valuation to $ 500M. Ant Financial participated in a $ 200M investment into Qudian in 2015, adding Qudian’ s alternative lending platform to its portfolio of fintech offerings. The IPO gave Luo a net worth of at least $ 1.2B, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Among Qudian’ s principal shareholders, Kunlun Worldwide held just under a 20% stake at the time of filing. Source Code Capital — which invested in its Series A through E rounds — held about 16%, and Ant Financial-owned API ( Hong Kong) Investment Limited held 12.8% at the time of IPO. Qudian’ s micro-lending service based on alternative data collection models was not heavily regulated until late 2017, when the Chinese government told authorities to put a pause on issuing new licenses. The expectation of growing government scrutiny wiped away Qudian shares’ short-lived gain. From its $ 24 IPO price, its stock had dropped to nearly $ 13 by mid-December 2017. In an attempt to diversify sources of revenue amidst looming regulatory threat to its core offering, Qudian launched its auto financing business in November 2017, known as Dabai Auto. The company established 175 off-line showrooms in shopping districts across China by the end of January 2018, and leased out over 4,800 cars as of March 10th. Amidst fear of unfavorable regulation from the Chinese government, Qudian’ s stock struggles in the public market. The biggest backers like Guosheng Financial and Kunlun have sold a nominal stake during the IPO and Guosheng has even talked of the price drop as an opportunity to increase its stake in Qudian. In the Q4 2017 earnings call, CEO Luo announced that he would forgo his salary and any bonus until the company reached a market cap of $ 100B ( Qudian’ s market cap was <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 5B at the time). Secrecy, a stealthy drug development, and fund-raising history helped Acerta Pharma become a huge multibillion-dollar pharma exit. AstraZeneca’ s majority stake ( 55%) in biotech firm Acerta Pharma for $ 4B was one of the biggest VC-backed exits of 2015. As part of the deal, AstraZeneca also had the option to sell the remaining 45% of Acerta Pharma ( upon meeting certain regulatory conditions). In all, the deal valued Acerta Pharma at over $ 7B. The company began operations in 2013, aiming to deliver novel targeted therapies to patients with cancer. The company’ s lead investigational blood cancer drug — a Bruton Tyrosine kinase ( BTK) inhibitor known as Acalabrutinib — posed a great opportunity to build its hematology/oncology pipeline. Acalubrutinib’ s potential as a more potent and selective inhibitor ( having fewer side-effects) than approved drugs meant huge potential for commercial success. Among its financings, the company raised a Series B round from T. Rowe Price. This funding was also raised in much secrecy, with no press release. Part of keeping the news under wraps was that an incumbent company, Pharmacyclics, had a product that Acerta was aiming to disrupt. The company’ s acquisition was a beneficial exit for Series A investors such as BioGeneration Ventures, Brabant Development Agency, Frazier Healthcare, OrbiMed Advisors, as well as Series B Investor T. Rowe Price. AstraZeneca’ s big bet on Acerta Pharma seems to have paid off. In October 2017, the FDA granted accelerated approval of its Acalabrutinib drug — Calquence. This approval <span class="passive">was considered</span> especially important for adults with mantle cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that is often diagnosed at a later stage and has a high relapse rate. Nexon ‘ s $ 1.2B IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 2011 was one of the biggest gaming exits at the time. Nexon is known for pioneering a play-for-free business model in which gamers only pay for virtual in-game goods, which become crucial to their progress in the game. Nexon began operations in 1994 out of Seoul, South Korea, but later moved its headquarters to Tokyo. The company has grown into one of Asia’ s biggest game publishers, with titles like MapleStory, Mabinogi, Vindictus, Combat Arms, Dragon Nest, and Dungeon Fighter Online to its name. In 2005, SoftBank Ventures Korea and Insight Venture Partners participated in the only known venture funding round to Nexon. The company’ s IPO was one of two big gaming company exits in late 2011. San Francisco-based gaming company Zynga’ s IPO on the NASDAQ exchange was the other, valued at <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 7B. In the US, there was much more hype <span class="weasel">around</span> Zynga’ s IPO due to the company’ s strong grasp on the US gaming market. Since going public, Nexon’ s stock has increased by more than 230% — Zynga’ s has lost <span class="weasel">approximately</span> 60% of its value. Nexon’ s biggest advantage over Zynga was facilitating its own in-app purchases. Zynga used social media platforms like Facebook to sell in-app goods because it gave the company access to Facebook’ s rapidly growing userbase — but it cost up to 30% in transaction fees. Nexon had already established its position as an independent game publisher before social media platforms took off in its core geographic markets of Japan, South Korea, and China. Sometimes companies that repeatedly return to the private market’ s funding well grow overstuffed with financing. They delay going public and end up floundering because they are unable to tighten up operations enough to turn a profit. Eventually, investors sour on them. But Zalando is the story of a company that raised hundreds of millions of dollars through equity and secondary share sales before IPO, and still succeeded. At a $ 6.8B valuation, Zalando’ s October 2014 IPO is the biggest exit of a Rocket Internet portfolio company to date ( see above for Rocket’ s own exit). Rocket Internet backed the e-commerce platform in 2008, the same year it launched. Zalando’ s company history. Source: IPO filing Germany-based Zalando <span class="passive">was launched</span> with an initial focus on footwear, but has since expanded to apparel. Robert Gentz and David Schneider launched Zalando after a failed attempt at starting a social media platform for students in Latin America, followed by a brief stint working under the Samwer brothers. Rocket Internet took a majority stake in the startup after a seed round financing in late 2008, where it co-invested with frequent collaborator Holtzbrinck Ventures. Zalando grew rapidly in its core DACH region ( Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), and in August 2010, it closed another round of investment from Holtzbrinck Ventures, Swedish investor Kinnevik, and Tengelmann at a valuation of $ 484M. At the close of this round, Rocket Internet still held a huge stake ( 59%) and Holtzbrinck upped its ownership to 17%, while Tengelmann and the founders owned just over 10% each. Kinnevik held 3% of the company. Zalando’ s expansion continued, but with it came a high burn-rate and a need to raise equity. In February 2012, Zalando raised an undisclosed amount from Yuri Milner’ s DST Global for a 4% stake. Later in the year, it raised debt and equity from a host of investment banking and PE firms including JPMorgan Chase, Quadrant Capital Advisors, CommerzBank, and others. Involvement of late-stage investor DST Global initiated rumors of an impending IPO and raised doubts about Zalando’ s ability to perform in public markets. Zalando had been growing fast, but had yet to show an annual operating profit. But doubts about Zalando’ s profit prospects didn’ t seem to affect its ability to raise funds. Over the next two years, Zalando went on to raise $ 650M in funding and multiplied its private market valuation tenfold to about $ 4.85B. In late 2012, Kinnevik followed on its earlier investment in Zalando with a $ 376M secondary market purchase at a valuation of $ 3.76B. Kinnevik reportedly had over 25% direct stake in Zalando after this deal. Zalando turned a profit for the first time in 2014, when it reported first-half profits of $ 16M compared to a loss of more than $ 90M in the same period during the previous year. Zalando and Rocket Internet both went public in the same week in October 2014, which was one of the biggest months ever for German tech startups, the Samwer brothers, and Kinnevik. Zalando listed 11% of its shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange at a price of €21.50 ( $ 27.28). Major shareholders like Kinnevik and others entered in the customary 180-day lockup period, which prohibited it from selling its stake in the public markets for 180 days from the first trading day. Even as the threat of Amazon stealing market share seems <span class="weasel">likely</span>, Zalando has performed well in its 3.5 years as a public company, with its stock up nearly 150% since IPO and a market cap of $ 14B+ as of March 2018. Chinese app-based chauffeured car service Ucar Group held its IPO in July 2016 on China’ s NEEQ exchange ( AKA The New Third Board) at a $ 5.5B valuation. It was the biggest IPO of a Chinese tech company in 2016. Ucar <span class="passive">was launched</span> in January 2015 by China’ s leading car rental group China Auto Rental ( CAR Inc.). Unlike other ride-hailing services, Ucar uses its own professional vehicles and drivers. Ucar closed its $ 250M Series A round within 7 months of its launch, valuing the company at $ 1.25B. Ucar’ s partner CAR Inc. invested $ 125M in the round, and the other $ 125M came from Warburg Pincus and Beijing-based Legend Holdings. At the time of this deal, Ucar was already covering 60 cities, largely enabled by its partnership with CAR Inc. CAR Inc.’ s founder and CEO Charles Zhengyao Lu’ s family also controlled a majority of Ucar at the time. Moving quickly, Ucar finalized access to additional funds in September 2015, closing a $ 550M Series B funding round at $ 3.55B valuation. Previous backers CAR Inc., Warburg Pincus, and Legend Holdings participated in the financing round, joined by Credit Suisse and others. This aggressive fundraising is telling of China’ s highly competitive on-demand car sharing market, where Ucar fell third behind Uber and Didi in terms of funding at the time. In March 2016, tech giant Alibaba had reportedly invested $ 461M in Ucar for a 10% ownership stake. Alibaba already had stakes in Uber and Didi Kuaidi ( formed by the merger of car-hailing rivals Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache in China), so this investment was done without much media coverage. In April 2016, Ucar’ s CEO Charles Lu confirmed that Alibaba had invested in the company, but said that the tech giant would be transferring its stake to affiliated funds Yunfeng Capital and Yunling Capital at the same price. Ucar filed for a public listing in April 2016 and <span class="passive">was suspected</span> to be “ very, very cash-strapped after the cutthroat competition with its rival Didi Chuxing and Uber, ” according to an analyst. Chinese ride-hailing competitors as of August 2016. Source: WSJ Ucar Group <span class="passive">was listed</span> for trading in July 2016. This was a big exit for Warburg Pincus, having invested in both Series A and B round deals to Ucar Group. The New York-based private equity firm has participated in massive funding rounds in Asia tech in the last few years. Almost one year after its IPO, Ucar received a $ 353M strategic investment from investor Piccamc, a joint venture set up by People’ s Insurance Company ( Group) of China Ltd. and Germany’ s Munich Re Asset Management Co. China UnionPay and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. also invested in Ucar earlier in 2017. Even after Uber conceded in the Chinese market by merging its China operations with rival Didi Chuxing, Ucar continues to struggle to gain market share. Ucar has <span class="passive">been supported</span> largely by its strategic partner CAR Inc.’ s dominance in the car rental space and additional private investments since its IPO. On its first day of public trading in November 1999, online grocery company Webvan closed at a market capitalization of $ 7.9B, with its stock price rising 65% above its initial offering price. A darling of Silicon Valley, Webvan was able to attract almost $ 400M in funding from venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and Benchmark. However, Webvan’ s hefty warchest, backed by big-name investors, only served to underline its reputation as one of the biggest dot-com failures when it eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Despite this, Webvan’ s initial success is not a surprise. The company’ s vision was bold — to leverage this new thing called the internet to allow people to order fresh groceries to their home at the touch of a button, tapping into a whole market of demand that was not possible just a few years prior. This was no doubt an attractive prospect to investors. In an era where fast growth <span class="passive">was prioritized</span> above all else, Webvan rolled out beyond its home in the San Francisco Bay Area to cities such as Seattle, Chicago, and Atlanta, with an ultimate 26-city expansion plan. However, the company’ s hyper growth masked its shaky foundation. “ [ Webvan ] committed the cardinal sin of retail, which is to expand into a new territory – in our case <span class="weasel">several</span> territories – before we had demonstrated success in the first market. ” — Michael Moritz, Partner, Sequoia Capital Webvan’ s leadership was not native to the grocery space. Webvan <span class="passive">was founded</span> by Louis Borders ( ironically the founder of defunct bookstore chain Borders). Neither its first CEO George Shaheen of Andersen Consulting, nor its second CEO Robert Swan, came directly from the grocery industry. Given the unique perils of operating in the grocery business, one marked by excessively low margins, a fundamental understanding of pricing, demand, delivery costs, and profitability is critical to long-term success. Moreover, according to Webvan’ s former head of technology, Peter Relan, the company geared itself toward the wrong target audience. Instead of catering to customers who <span class="weasel">could</span> afford the higher cost of grocery delivery, Webvan marketed itself as a company offering “ Whole Foods ” quality food, and “ Safeway ” prices. This put Webvan into a position where it was difficult to become profitable, since it essentially was promising lower prices despite the high cost it took to fulfill and deliver each order. Beyond pricing, Webvan’ s decision to build its own fulfillment warehouses from scratch set the company back even further. For a cost of up to $ 40M, Webvan would build a complex automated warehouse designed to fulfill its orders in any given region. This set up an even higher barrier to profitably than the company already faced. As the company continued to grow beyond its means, it spent almost $ 800M, even signing a $ 1B contract with Bechtel to build <span class="weasel">several</span> more automated warehouses. However, when the market crashed in 2000, Webvan lost its ability to raise more capital. Given the inability of the company to operate profitability on its own, it <span class="passive">was forced</span> to file for bankruptcy and ceased operations. Almost two decades later, businesses offering grocery delivery can take many cues from Webvan’ s ultimate failure. For example, Instacart took a different approach than Webvan in its first few years of operation. While Instacart brought in a much smaller amount of revenue, it ran a much leaner business reliant on fewer full-time employees, relying mostly on contracted delivery drivers. Additionally, it completely cuts out Webvan’ s massive warehouse costs by leveraging existing grocery stores as fulfillment centers. Given the continued high cost and complexity of logistics, it remains important for grocery delivery providers to understand the unit economics of their businesses, and potential routes to profitability, before recklessly expanding. However, as logistics and warehouse innovation continue to modernize, such as with the advent of robotic micro-fulfillment startups like Fabric, providing cheap grocery delivery <span class="weasel">may</span> become a more realistic proposition going forward. Unfortunately, this will be a few decades too late for Webvan. Qualtrics’ explosive $ 8B exit was <span class="weasel">significant</span> for the company, which remained free of venture funding for over a decade. It is also one of the largest VC-backed enterprise software acquisitions in history ( in terms of first-time exits), edging out Microsoft’ s $ 7.5B acquisition of GitHub in October 2018. The Utah-based customer survey software company <span class="passive">was started</span> by CEO and co-founder Ryan Smith and his father Dr. Scott Smith ( a university professor) in 2002. The startup initially focused on selling to academics, beginning with business schools. The father and son duo worked out of their family basement, running operations, prospecting, and building the company from the ground up. Nearly 2 years later, they sought the technical help of the eldest Smith son Jared, who initially described the code as “ unscalable junk. ” Despite his skepticism, Jared helped them rewrite the program before heading off to work on product at Google. He later returned to Qualtrics. The company was known for rejecting investment offers, and remained bootstrapped for over a decade. In 2012, Ryan turned down a $ 500M offer for the business, which at the time was doing $ 50M in revenue. But eventually, Ryan decided he wanted “ a board of people who had grown huge tech companies. ” In that same year, and after <span class="weasel">some</span> disagreement with Jared, the company finally agreed to raise a $ 70M Series A from Sequoia Capital and Accel, each of which went on to participate in the next two and final funding rounds. Qualtrics continued to grow, and prior to its acquisition by SAP, had filed its S-1 and planned to raise as much as $ 495M as part of its upcoming IPO. SAP CEO Bill McDermott stepped in with an $ 8B cash offer, and the deal <span class="passive">is expected</span> to close in early 2019. SAP’ s acquisition of Qualtrics is the second-largest in the company’ s history, behind its $ 8.3B purchase of expense management platform Concur. Notably, Qualtrics built itself from the ground up, decided against selling “ early, ” and took on capital later in its life — and now the company is looking at huge returns. In Japan, investors talk in terms of “ before Mercari ” and “ after Mercari. ” That’ s how <span class="weasel">significant</span> the Mercari IPO was. Mercari operates a booming online, app-based flea market. The company raised $ 1.2B in its June 2018 IPO, bringing its valuation to $ 3.7B. This made Mercari Japan’ s first unicorn tech startup and blew open the doors of a nascent tech startup scene. It also meant early investor United Inc. saw a 150x+ return on its investment. Japan-based United had jumped in with a $ 3M investment in a Series A round in 2013. Just 5 years later, that stake was worth more than $ 400M. Mercari’ s founder Shintaro Yamada was a game industry veteran who had sold his first company to Zynga. Yamada came up with the idea for the Mercari flea market app after traveling the world and realizing that even the poorest people carried cell phones. Mercari quickly grew to dominate the second-hand sales market in Japan, but now must look to expand internationally. Source: Statista Local investors — most of them corporations like United — understood that he had something special. Foreign investors didn’ t. They didn’ t realize that the lower wealth of individual users was offset by the huge numbers that <span class="weasel">could</span> be signed up. And, despite Japan’ s role as an economic powerhouse on the world stage, the country’ s startup ecosystem was still tiny. There were few notable exits and most talent was flocking to safe corporate jobs. In just a few years, however, as tech startups <span class="weasel">around</span> the world began to make headlines, the Japanese startup scene has also caught fire, sparked in large part by Mercari’ s success. Investors today are much more tuned into the startup landscape in Japan. Mercari’ s success showcases the importance of looking at a company’ s surrounding local culture as well as its financials when evaluating nascent startups for potential. Your peers <span class="weasel">may</span> be hesitant, but local investors <span class="weasel">may</span> well be seeing something they’ re not. As startup fever catches, less obvious places can turn out to be winners. Post-Mercari Japan is looking like just that. There’ s an electric car boom coming to China, and Tencent doesn’ t <span class="weasel">plan to</span> be left behind. The Chinese internet giant was the primary investor and early backer of NIO, considered to be China’ s Tesla. At NIO’ s September 2018 IPO, Tencent held 15.2% of the electric carmaker. The company went public at a valuation of about $ 6.4B in September 2018. NIO has had <span class="weasel">some</span> hiccups, but managed to hit 10,000 cars shipped in the second half of 2018. ( In comparison, Tesla sold about 14,000 cars in China in the first 9 months of the same year.) Tencent has also invested in Tesla, taking a 5% stake for $ 1.8B in 2017. The move signaled that Tencent is looking to cash in on a <span class="weasel">likely</span> bonanza when electric cars go mainstream. Playing both sides of the street ensures it will hold <span class="weasel">significant</span> market share whether Tesla or the Chinese brand becomes the top seller. While not well known in the US, NIO <span class="passive">is poised</span> to be a leader in China, where the growing middle class is seeking fuel efficient transportation. Between June and September 2018, NIO’ s production rose from 100 units a month to more than 1,700. Source: Statista Tesla, for its part, is building a plant in China, and expected to ramp up production. It remains to be seen whether Chinese consumers will favor the more established Tesla brand. NIO is undercutting Tesla on price, offering an SUV for about half the cost of a Tesla model. In addition to its investments in the two automakers, Tencent received its own license from the Chinese government to test an autonomous vehicle in the city of Shenzhen. When an industry is in its infancy, smart investors hedge their bets. Tencent has done just that, taking a major stake in its competitors as well as backing its own brand. In the early days of an industry set to explode, covering all bases can be a winning strategy, especially for investors with deep pockets. Since the company’ s 2010 founding, Sequoia Capital China has put more than $ 400M into the Chinese services platform Meituan. Sequoia also helped coordinate the crucial 2015 joining of forces between the company and its rival Dianping — a $ 15B merger. When now-merged Meituan Dianping recently raised $ 4.2B in an IPO that valued the company at $ 55B, the value of Sequoia’ s holdings in the company hit about $ 4.91B — a greater than 12x return on its investment. Meituan Dianping has grown into a broad-based services provider, dealing in everything from movie tickets to restaurant reservations. Source: GGV Capital Meituan started out as a Groupon imitator, but eventually, it emerged as one of the few Chinese deal-of-the-day sites ( there were <span class="weasel">around</span> 2,000 voucher sites in China at the time) with the revenue and user base to grow beyond that. Today, it is a broad-based services provider, dealing in everything from movie tickets to restaurant reservations. Sequoia, as well as Chinese giants Alibaba and Tencent, backed the company from early on. In the tech community of China, the successful Meituan Dianping IPO was a sign that Chinese tech IPOs were on the rebound, after <span class="weasel">some</span> pessimism surrounding the public offerings of Xiaomi and Nio, which both priced <span class="weasel">around</span> the bottom of their range. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi officially became the third most valuable smartphone manufacturer in the world when it went public in July 2018 at a valuation of $ 54B. In that IPO, the largest backer of the company, Morningside Ventures, made back more than 40x its investment. It was the most successful investment ever for the firm, led by Chinese venture capitalist Liu Qin, who met the founder of Xiaomi ( Lei Jun) when he was working at Kingsoft in 2003. They co-invested in UCWeb, a deal in which they profited when the company sold to Alibaba. Xiaomi has become the third most popular smartphone maker in the world, thanks to Morningside Ventures’ vote of confidence. Source: CNBC When Lei told Liu he was going to work on a mobile phone company, Liu had the inside line to invest in the new company — and it fit his investment priorities perfectly. Liu and Morningside’ s approach has been to invest in companies that are capital efficient, even as other investors clamor to invest in companies working on capital-intensive industries like ride-sharing. Xiaomi was, comparatively, relatively efficient. At the time, the product was, of course, underdeveloped, and it was critical that Liu and Lei had trust in one another. Without the vision they shared for the company, there would not have been a convincing reason for Morningside to invest — and no returns either.

Tencent-backed Pinduoduo raised a total of $ 1.6B in its July 2018 IPO at a valuation of almost $ 30B. Sequoia Capital China and Tencent began investing in the Chinese e-commerce company starting in its Series B round, in which Pinduoduo raised $ 110M in 2016. Post-IPO, Tencent controls about 17% of the company, with Sequoia’ s ownership share coming in at about 6.8%. Like the Alibaba service Taobao, Pinduoduo allows users to buy a wide range of products online, though it differs in its social mechanisms. Pinduoduo allows users to band together with friends and family to make group purchases and get a better price. Pinduoduo ( left) vs. Taobao ( right). Source: TechNode Tencent’ s investment in Pinduoduo goes beyond just the financial aspect. Users transacting on the Pinduoduo app use the Tencent service WeChat to communicate with buyers and sellers and can also get group discounts for doing so. Tencent’ s investment has also allowed Pinduoduo to tap into the ubiquitousness of the WeChat app — which <span class="passive">is used</span> by nearly 1.1B people worldwide — rather than, as <span class="weasel">some</span> of Pinduoduo’ s competitors require, making users download a new, separate app. Of those competitors, none looms larger for Tencent than Alibaba. In its struggle for supremacy, Pinduoduo is one of Tencent’ s latest attempts to undermine its biggest competitor by providing a more convenient competing service. Chinese local delivery startup Ele.me <span class="passive">was valued</span> at about $ 9.5B when Alibaba bought full ownership of the company in April 2018. Before the acquisition, Alibaba — together with affiliates Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co.— controlled <span class="weasel">approximately</span> 43% of the company. Prior to its Ele.me investment, Alibaba had failed to achieve the same kind of brick-and-mortar delivery presence that its main competitors Tencent and Meituan have had in the services space. With Ele.me, Alibaba was able to compete with its rivals Tencent and Meituan in the delivery services space. Source: The Hustle Ele.me, however, was recording almost $ 9.5M every single day in orders from more than 40M customers in more than 250 cities <span class="weasel">around</span> China. Moving to consolidate control is a common theme for Alibaba: slowly building up its stake in a company, learning about how it works, and learning about the space is a way for Alibaba to bolster its own product and service lines over time, rather than all at once in a traditional acquisition. When it went public in June 2018, Dutch payments startup Adyen’ s stock rose by more than 66% — by the end of the day, the company had a market cap of more than $ 15B. Adyen handles payments for companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Facebook and processed $ 127B in payments in 2017 alone. The company’ s VC backers include Iconiq Capital, General Atlantic, and Index Ventures, which led Adyen’ s $ 16M Series A round in 2014. At IPO, Index Ventures held a 17% stake in the company, making its share worth more than $ 2.55B — a 159x return on a $ 16M investment. Not long after its IPO, Adyen’ s value was nearly $ 20B and Index’ s share was worth more than $ 3B. Index noticed Adyen for three reasons. First, the company had rapid growth, largely because its customers were avid evangelists of the brand and the product. Second, it was profitable ( not another cash-burning Silicon Valley startup). And most importantly, it had only raised a few million dollars by that point, so the company wasn’ t over-invested. Index was able to offer Adyen something it wasn’ t getting from its European VC suitors: an emphasis on and assistance breaking into other markets <span class="weasel">around</span> the world, including the US. Today, Adyen is a primary payments processor for many companies across the United States, including Facebook and eBay. In June 2018, in one of the biggest US venture-backed acquisitions of the last decade, Microsoft paid an eye-popping $ 7.5B for open source startup GitHub. But back in 2012, when Andreessen Horowitz poured $ 100M into the startup, many in Silicon Valley thought the firm was grossly overpaying. It was a massive gamble at the time. That initial Series A round was the largest check Andreessen Horowitz had ever written. GitHub was in an unknown and misunderstood corner of the tech world. The startup had no clear path, no real product, and no sales organization. But Marc Andreessen believed strongly that “ software is eating the world. ” Inside Andreessen Horowitz, the things GitHub lacked didn’ t matter — what mattered was that it had the attention and the adoration of people who built software. The site was the first large-scale open-source meeting place for developers. Open-source <span class="passive">was founded</span> on the belief that code can and <span class="weasel">should</span> be shared and collaborative. GitHub made that vision into a reality by providing a place on the internet where a community of developers <span class="weasel">could</span> work on any project they liked. Andreessen Horowitz saw the potential for disruption in how software is built. GitHub, it realized, was the platform where this <span class="weasel">could</span> happen. Instead of companies working within their own walled gardens, they <span class="weasel">could</span> open their code up to the world and tap into the collective wisdom of the crowd. As partner Peter Levine later recalled about his first meeting with the founders, GitHub was a little rough <span class="weasel">around</span> the edges. But it had something better than anything a slick marketing department <span class="weasel">could</span> deliver: developers <span class="weasel">around</span> the world were flocking to the site. Their enthusiasm meant GitHub was growing by 100% year-over-year through word of mouth. The company had revenues and cash flow. What Levine saw wasn’ t a collection of developers, but a platform that <span class="weasel">could</span> launch the new digital economy. It <span class="weasel">could</span> transform how many of the world’ s technologies are built, covering everything from apps to enterprise software and beyond. Microsoft, ironically, was once among the loudest opponents to the idea of open-source. But major improvements in software proved out this way of working. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was warmer to the idea than his predecessor Steve Ballmer, and in the end Microsoft became GitHub’ s largest contributor. When Andreessen Horowitz had made its $ 100M investment, GitHub <span class="passive">was valued</span> at roughly $ 750M. The VC’ s <span class="weasel">support</span> helped the fledgling company take off, and it was soon adding an average of 10,000 users a day. GitHub user growth. Source: Growth Hackers Thanks to a16z’ s initial cash infusion, GitHub matured as a company, and in 2015 it raised a $ 250M Series B round led by Sequoia Capital. Andreessen Horowitz also participated, along with other top tier players Thrive Capital, IVP, and SV Angel. GitHub’ s valuation jumped to more than $ 2B. Six years after a smart initial investment, Andreessen Horowitz’ s bet has paid off in spades. The VC took home over $ 1B in the exit, having locked in its shares by investing in that initial round. It was a big payday for the firm, which had the vision to recognize that collaborative, social coding was the future. In 2008, e-commerce was almost nonexistent in India, and even brick-and-mortar retail chains were struggling. But that’ s just when Accel decided to take a chance on online retailer Flipkart with an $ 800K seed investment. Ten years later, in 2018, Walmart paid a whopping $ 16B to acquire Flipkart in a deal that valued the e-commerce company at $ 20.8B. What <span class="weasel">could</span> have been a mistimed move turned out to be one of the largest deals ever for a private venture-backed company. And the deal made Flipkart’ s investors rich, not least of all early champion Accel, which made about $ 1.1B. In the deal, Walmart bought 77% of Flipkart, becoming the Indian e-commerce startup’ s corporate parent. The deal boosted the US retailer in its war with Amazon to cash in on the lucrative India market. It ranks among Accel’ s biggest global exits, and cemented Accel India’ s reputation for backing winners. Back in 2008, despite a growing middle class, most people went to their local shops. They didn’ t trust internet buying except when it came to travel such as rail and air tickets. There also wasn’ t the infrastructure to ship packages <span class="weasel">around</span> India. Other VCs such as Sequoia passed on Flipkart. But Accel saw something in the founders, Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal, two former Amazon employees who believed they <span class="weasel">could</span> build the same kind of e-commerce empire in their own country. Between 2013 and 2016, retail e-commerce sales in India grew from $ 2.31B a year to more than $ 24B. Source: Statista Accel had just opened the India office, and was on the lookout for “ unconventional and audacious businesses, ” as the partners later wrote. Emerging markets such as India are high risk, high reward. Accel made its India fund semi-independent and hired mostly Indian partners with a focus on early-stage startups. Even today, 60% of the Accel India portfolio is in seed stage, and most other investments are at the Series A and B level. This makes for an agile team that stays engaged with the standouts in the ecosystem. While it’ s fashionable for investors to say they’ re looking for visionary founders, in these kind of emerging markets this is just one key trait to look for. Founders must also have deep knowledge of the challenges they’ re facing and be open to experimenting with new ideas. This is what the Accel India partners saw in the Bansals. In order to make its vision a reality, Flipkart built from scratch the infrastructure that companies in the developed world take for granted. This included a network of national logistics centers and delivery fleets. The company also pioneered ways to make buying online appealing, with cash on delivery, doorstep debit/credit payments, and monthly installments. With the ball rolling, investors jumped in and pumped about $ 7B into the company over the next decade. These investors spanned the globe, including Tiger Global, Naspers, SoftBank, Morgan Stanley, Tencent, and Microsoft, to name just a few. Flipkart has remained the top e-commerce site, despite numerous management changes and the eventual departure of both founders. Plenty of investors did well in the Spotify IPO on April 3, 2018, when the streaming platform <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 29.5B. But early then-small Swedish VC firm and early investor Creandum walked away with an 80x return on its investment. In total, Creandum invested about $ 4.5M into the company for an <span class="weasel">approximately</span> 6% stake. At exit, its stake in the company <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 370M. Creandum led the also-Swedish company’ s first venture round — but it wasn’ t love at first sight. Before investing, Creandum and Spotify met regularly to talk and consult for 18 months. Those negotiations created a deep personal connection between Creandum and Spotify, and also gave Creandum the opportunity to get an inside take on whether or not it <span class="weasel">should</span> invest. Eventually, it did. Over the decade following Creandum’ s investment, Spotify rocketed from an unknown Swedish startup to the most popular on-demand music streaming service in the world. Stockholm-based Spotify was far from a sure bet when Creandum first took a look in 2007. Most investors didn’ t want to touch it. The music industry was risky, had razor thin margins, and opened a world of headaches in negotiating with industry execs. Creandum partner Fredrik Cassel later recalled being skeptical of the co-founders’ claim that the service <span class="weasel">could</span> play any song in the world. Cassel named an obscure Swedish artist, The Bear Quartet. To his amazement, Spotify pulled up every song the band had ever recorded. In the decade following Creandum’ s investment, Spotify became the most popular on-demand music streaming service in the world. Source: Quartz Equally impressive for Creandum was that Spotify had developed a mobile app that worked just as seamlessly as the desktop version. The dominant phone then was the Nokia, and Spotify had built a fully functioning app for the Nokia Series 60. The functionality was flawless, and at the demo, “ jaws dropped. ” During the 18 months before Creandum invested, Cassel got to know co-founders Martin Lorentzon and Daniel Ek, saying that he “ saw qualities in them that others missed. ” At the same time, there was no easy or even fully legal way to make a business out of downloading music. Napster fell afoul of the music industry over copyright issues and <span class="passive">was shuttered</span> in 2001. Others tried to fill the gap, but those efforts also ended up in ugly lawsuits. One service, Kazaa, not only owed millions, but put its own customers at risk as the powerful recording industry threatened Kazaa’ s users with lawsuits for piracy. Despite this, many people took their chances downloading music through any of a number of quasi legal services that rose and fell. Spotify’ s founders knew their product had to beat those services if it was to win. Their stated goal was: “ This needs to be better than piracy. ” With immense barriers to entry and difficult markets, there are also rich rewards. However, to capitalize, investors can’ t just throw money at a company — they need to invest the time to build a relationship, so that when the word gets out about the company’ s success, they’ ve earned their seat at the table. As the first round began to come together, investors were waking up to Spotify’ s potential. Ek and Lorentzon were choosy about their investment team, and their relationship with Cassel sealed the deal. As Cassel recalled, “ [ We ] were closer to the company than nearly anyone else in the venture scene which allowed us to pull the trigger and actually invest. ” By following this playbook, Creandum locked in a solid chunk of what would turn out to be Europe’ s most valuable startup. At its IPO in March 2018, file sharing startup Dropbox had a $ 12.7B valuation, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. With this exit, Sequoia Capital saw a jaw dropping $ 2B return on its investment. The Dropbox story is an object lesson in how to keep a promising startup in your court and reap outsized rewards. In brief, Sequoia’ s strategy was to do an end run <span class="weasel">around</span> the traditional financing process, keeping other investors out while building a special relationship with the Dropbox founders. By the time Dropbox’ s valuation ballooned from the low millions to billions, Sequoia had locked in its shares. Those who came in late to the party shelled out far more for smaller pieces of the pie. Dropbox’ s annual revenues went from $ 200M in 2013 to more than $ 1B as of 2017. Sequoia’ s home run shows the power of getting in early and backing a winner. But it also teaches that you don’ t have to follow the usual script with risky early-stage startups in promising new markets. Dropbox was far from a sure thing when co-founders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi walked through Sequoia’ s doors in 2007. It was just one startup in a sea of contenders trying to cash in on the emerging cloud storage space. Talented MIT trained engineers, Houston and Ferdowsi were fresh out of Y Combinator. But the accelerator hadn’ t yet become the mighty force it is today. The founders were entering an untested market full of sharks and fraught with technical challenges. Already, other cloud storage startups had flamed out after losing mission critical documents ( or cherished wedding albums). And Dropbox didn’ t look like it was on a fast track or much of a winner. Many VCs were eyeing other entrants, like fellow Y Combinator classmate SugarSync. Despite all this, Sequoia led a $ 1.2M seed round for Dropbox in 2007. The company didn’ t launch until a full year later, in 2008 — a long time for an early-stage startup. Though 75,000 early adopters signed on as beta customers after Dropbox posted a demo on geek site Digg, growth then stagnated. The founders tried advertising techniques — PR and Google Adwords. They didn’ t work. The problem? No one was searching for a solution they didn’ t know existed. At this point, Dropbox was spending $ 400 per customer acquisition, far more than the price of the product. As Houston later recalled at a 2010 Stanford symposium, the situation was “ horrific. ” Despite this, Sequoia led a $ 6M Series A round in 2008, looping in one other firm, Accel. At this point, many VCs would have pushed the company to add more marketing and SEO talent to fix the problem. Given Dropbox’ s burn rate, this would’ ve meant leading another round and bringing on new investors. Sequoia instead came up with a different plan. The firm offered to extend financing to the startup to keep it afloat. This wasn’ t about raising another round. No others would be involved. This strategy locked in Sequoia’ s large stake. With almost zero dilution, Sequoia soon held 23% of the company shares, second only to Houston’ s holdings. In just 15 months between 2008 — 2010, the company went from 100K registered users to 4M. And it didn’ t end there. Revenues skyrocketed as word of mouth spread <span class="weasel">around</span> the globe. Thanks to this stratospheric growth, Dropbox’ s share price shot up by 150x between 2008 and 2011. And because it was flush with revenue, the startup didn’ t follow the usual path of raising growth rounds. Dropbox was on its way to becoming an integral part of the digital environment. The financial <span class="weasel">support</span> Sequoia offered was key to Dropbox’ s success. This meant a massive payout for the VC firm. And this early vote of confidence helped make Dropbox the company it is today, with millions of users and a global footprint. Coinbase went public in April 2021 — an event that marked, in the words of Gil Luria, an analyst at investment firm D.A. Davidson, “ the epiphany for everyone that [ cryptocurrency ] is real. ” The Coinbase crypto exchange, founded 9 years earlier by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 65.3B for its stock market debut. Coinbase exited via direct listing instead of a traditional IPO. This means that the company didn’ t raise any money, but its shareholders and investors <span class="weasel">could</span> sell shares and cash in their investments. And Coinbase’ s IPO meant huge profits for <span class="weasel">several</span> VC investors. Coinbase share prices during multiple funding rounds, secondary trades, and its direct listing. Source: CNBC Union Square Ventures, for instance, contributed $ 5M to Coinbase’ s $ 6.1M Series A round in 2013, which valued Coinbase at $ 20M for 20 cents a share. Eight years later, this bet was worth <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 4.6B. USV partner Fred Wilson wrote in 2013 that Coinbase was the firm’ s first investment in the crypto sphere: “ We have been thinking about and looking to make an investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem for <span class="weasel">several</span> years. Today, we are happy to be able to talk about our first investment in the sector. ” Andreessen Horowitz is the biggest investor in Coinbase. The famed VC led a $ 25M Series B round, purchasing shares at $ 1 a piece, and has since bought an additional 3.5M shares from USV. Overall, Andreessen’ s stake in Coinbase was worth almost $ 10B in April 2021. The third-biggest investor in Coinbase is Ribbit Capital ( a CB Insights Fintech Smart Money VC). The fintech-focused VC owned 12M shares that were worth $ 3.9B when the crypto exchange went public. Other investors who profited from Coinbase’ s IPO include Tiger Global, Institutional Venture Partners, and DFJ Growth. Coinbase has seen massive growth, from counting 100K members in 2013 to over 56M customers in 2021. And this success story has prompted VCs to double down on their investments in crypto and blockchain startups. Andreessen Horowitz, for example, is planning to raise nearly $ 1B for a crypto investment fund, while USV will allocate nearly one third of its new $ 250M fund to crypto investments. These commitments highlight the belief that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is a new frontier for outsized returns. Uber went public in <span class="weasel">May</span> 2019, fetching a valuation of $ 75.5B. The ride-hailing giant also raised $ 8.1B by issuing 180M shares. This IPO was a massive payday for a number of VC investors. The group that stood to profit the most <span class="passive">were seed</span> investors. In 2010, Uber raised $ 1.5M in a seed round with investors paying $ 0.009 a share at a $ 4M valuation. First Round Capital invested $ 510,000, and the value of this stake reached $ 2.5B post-IPO. Lowercase Capital struck gold as well, with its initial seed investment of $ 300,000 growing to be worth $ 1.1B post-IPO. But there were also many other investors who backed Uber in 2010. Those who held onto their shares saw enormous payoff 9 years later. Over the years, Uber raised multiple rounds from major investors. SoftBank’ s Vision Fund invested $ 7B into Uber in 2017 and led a $ 1.3B round in 2018. By the time of the IPO, SoftBank’ s 16.3% stake was worth $ 10B. Benchmark Capital was also a major investor. In 2011, the firm invested $ 9M into the ride-hailing app, for a stake worth $ 6.8B eight years later. TPG Capital invested $ 90M in 2013 to reach $ 1.4B at the IPO, while Menlo Ventures took part in Uber’ s Series B round, amassing stock worth $ 1.9B in 2019 ( even after selling $ 1B worth of shares to SoftBank in 2017). Uber attracted investments from <span class="weasel">various</span> other investors, including Qatar Investment Authority, Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, and Toyota. All of them profited as the ride-hailing giant’ s value steadily increased from 2010 to 2019. Uber’ s share price has fluctuated since its exit. The company’ s market cap dropped to <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 50B in <span class="weasel">May</span> 2020 but has recovered since, reaching $ 96B in <span class="weasel">May</span> 2021. With revenue decreasing 30% year-over-year and layoffs of nearly 2K employees, Airbnb faced a brutal 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But the company started to recover in the second half of that year, and eventually went public in December at a $ 40.6B valuation. Among Airbnb’ s investors, Sequoia Capital in particular enjoyed massive returns. The VC firm invested <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 600K in 2009, securing 58M of Airbnb’ s shares at $ 0.01 per share. Apart from the seed deal, Sequoia also participated in 3 more rounds, investing $ 260M in total. The value of its stake at IPO price reached $ 4.8B. VC firm Greylock Partners was another leading investor. In 2010, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a partner at Greylock, convinced the firm to lead Airbnb’ s Series A and invest $ 4.9M, securing a stake worth <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 1.4B at IPO price. Unlike Greylock, Andreessen Horowitz decided not to take part in Airbnb’ s Series A. But as the home-sharing startup gained traction, the VC firm came to lead a Series B, investing $ 60M at a $ 1B valuation, then going on to back <span class="weasel">several</span> future rounds. At the time of IPO, Andreessen Horowitz’ s initial stake was worth $ 1B. Founders Fund also entered at the Series B stage. The firm, including Peter Thiel, Napoleon Ta, and other partners, invested $ 500K in the Series B, and also participated in the Series C by investing $ 150M, the fund’ s largest investment to date, which required obtaining permissions from limited partners. Ultimately, the risk paid off — Founders Fund’ s stake in Airbnb was worth $ 1.5B in December 2020. Airbnb also worked with many other investors throughout the years, including DST Global, Y Ventures, A-Grade Investments, General Catalyst, General Atlantic, TCV, and Silver Lake Partners. All of these firms profited when Airbnb went public. Buoyed by the shift to remote work brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, Zoom ‘ s video conferencing platform has become a household name. The company went public in April 2019, fetching a valuation of $ 9.2B at a share price of $ 36. Based on this price, many of Zoom’ s investors, executives, and employees had their stakes skyrocket in value. Zoom CEO and founder Eric Yuan owned 18.5% of the company, a stake worth $ 1.7B at the time of the IPO. Emergence Capital Partners had the largest external stake in Zoom, at 11.9%, worth $ 1.1B. This VC firm participated in Zoom’ s Series C and D rounds. Sequoia Capital achieved equally impressive returns. The VC firm owned 10.8% of the video-conferencing giant in April 2019, a stake worth <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 994M at the $ 36 share price. Sequoia only backed Zoom’ s Series D. Other investors in the company include Qualcomm Ventures and Horizons Ventures. Many investors initially believed that Zoom had no chance in a mature market dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Cisco, as well as smaller players such as GoToMeeting and FuzeBox. But Zoom proved to be a huge win. The company kept growing, and as the Covid-19 pandemic forced people to embrace remote work, Zoom’ s valuation rose rapidly. In March 2021, the company announced revenue growth of 326% year-over-year to reach $ 2.7B for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021. In <span class="weasel">May</span> 2021, Zoom’ s market cap stood at over $ 90B, a massive increase from the $ 9.2B valuation given during its IPO just 2 years prior. Snowflake’ s IPO showed that helping companies store, analyze, and share data across the cloud is a huge business opportunity. The cloud data warehousing company went public in September 2020, selling 28M shares and raising $ 3.4B at an initial valuation of $ 33.3B. While shares began at $ 120 apiece, they ended the first day trading at more than twice that ( $ 254). At this price point, Snowflake <span class="passive">was valued</span> at <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 70B, and its investors and shareholders enjoyed massive returns. At the time, Sutter Hill Ventures ( SHV), a Palo Alto-based VC firm, owned 20.3% of Snowflake’ s shares, a stake worth $ 12.6B, up from a total investment of less than $ 200M. SHV managing director Mike Speiser <span class="passive">was involved</span> with Snowflake from its early days. He served as the company’ s CEO and CFO from 2012 to 2014, helping the founders develop the product and hire staff. SHV is rarely mentioned alongside better-known VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, or Benchmark. It has a bare-bones website, and Speiser says that he only talks with media “ at the request of portfolio companies. ” But his willingness to invest not only money but also time and effort to help Snowflake demonstrates what it can take to achieve outsized returns. Snowflake had other investors, too. Altimeter Capital, an investment firm that led Snowflake’ s $ 45M Series C in 2015, owned 15% of the stock at the time of the IPO. This stake was worth <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 9.2B after the first day of trading. ICONIQ Capital was a lead investor in Snowflake’ s $ 100M Series D in 2017. ICONIQ held 14% of the data company’ s shares, worth $ 8.6B. Redpoint Ventures and Sequoia also saw a huge return on their investments: both held <span class="weasel">around</span> 9% of Snowflake’ s shares, which comes out to more than $ 5B for each VC. Even Warren Buffett’ s Berkshire Hathaway, an investment behemoth that typically prefers investing in mature companies, couldn’ t pass on Snowflake, investing $ 250M in a post-IPO private placement. Salesforce did the same. After the IPO, Snowflake stock kept rising. In December 2020, it reached a peak of $ 429 per share, though stock value has fallen by over 50% since then. As of <span class="weasel">May</span> 2021, Snowflake’ s shares were trading at over $ 200 apiece. Despite these ups and downs, Snowflake shows once again how timely investments in tech startups can yield massive returns for VC investors. And with data and cloud technologies becoming a vital component of today’ s economy, the company is well positioned to take advantage of this trend. After working through the data on the biggest VC exits of all time, we found that <span class="weasel">some</span> of the best VC deals of all time didn’ t come from tactics out of a playbook. They were the result of research, strong convictions, and committed follow-through. The global startup market is constantly becoming more dispersed and more efficient. Companies come from countries all <span class="weasel">around</span> the globe. Tools like AngelList have begun to level the playing field when it comes to “ finding ” the right companies, allowing individual investors to fish through startups for the next Uber or Facebook. Meanwhile, initial coin offerings allow startups and individual investors to connect through decentralized token sales. <span class="weasel">Some</span> of the only real clear advantages left are the simplest, and most challenging: doing your research, then putting in the work to help the companies that you invest in succeed.</td>

          <td class="txt">Is a new listing venue now available for Chinese firms that have seen their hopes of a US IPO dashed over the past year? If the recent announcements from four Mainland companies are any indication, Switzerland is the flavour of the month. Four Chinese companies moved in unison last week to announce their respective plans to list on the Swiss exchange through the sale of global depositary receipts ( GDRs). Two of them are already trading in Shanghai and the other two in Shenzhen. China has seen GDR listings before. In 2018, Haier Smart Home Co floated GDRs in Frankfurt, sealing the first D-share IPO on the China Europe International Exchange, a joint venture board in Germany, set up in 2015 by Deutsche Börse, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the China Financial Futures Exchange. A further four companies later went public in London through the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme, launched in June 2019. The planned Swiss IPO announcements come just a month after China officially expanded the Shanghai-London Connect to cover markets in Shenzhen, Germany and Switzerland. Perhaps more notably, they also come at a time when US-listed Chinese stocks — or American depositary receipts ( ADRs) — have been under immense selling pressure. While the ADR sell-off has eased after a series of attempts from Beijing to calm the market, the underlying concerns remain: that China and the US are yet to find a solution to the long-running dispute <span class="weasel">around</span> accounting regulations, and that even if the problem <span class="passive">is solved</span>, the US <span class="weasel">could</span> continue to clamp down on Mainland companies as the rise of China threatens its status as the global political and economic superpower. Against that backdrop, a new wave of GDRs is undoubtedly a sentiment booster — showing that amid increasing hostility from the US, Chinese companies <span class="weasel">might</span> have an overseas listing alternative in Europe. The SIX Swiss Exchange, the country’ s main stock exchange, is home to <span class="weasel">some</span> of the largest European listed firms by market capitalisation, such as Nestlé and Roche Holding. The developments also serve to <span class="weasel">promote</span> Beijing’ s opening-up agenda, and reinforces a message the government has been trying to convey to the market: that overseas IPOs are not really <span class="passive">being discouraged</span>. But while the prospect of a listing alternative in Europe is encouraging, the problems surrounding ADRs <span class="weasel">should</span> still take priority. After all, time is still needed to see if the Swiss market, or the broader European equities market, can really be regarded as a feasible equity funding channel for Chinese firms. No deals have materialised yet, so Chinese companies are yet to demonstrate that they indeed have access to the Swiss market. It is also unclear to what extent the market can <span class="weasel">support</span> firms’ funding needs and at what price. Neither has it been proven that there would be sufficient investor interest and strong reception to Mainland companies. There is also a question about secondary liquidity, as the Swiss Exchange only accounts for just about 10% of Europe’ s overall trading activity. Having hosted five new listings — all of which were domestic — last year, the Swiss Exchange is yet to prove it has the depth and investor breadth to <span class="weasel">support</span> not only secondary trading and liquidity but, more importantly, the potential primary listing needs of Chinese firms, as well as their ambitions of going global. ( Chinese companies raised over $ 12.6bn through US IPOs last year and nearly $ 13bn in 2020, according to Dealogic.) The firms gunning for a Swiss listing so far are leading private enterprises from the manufacturing sector — heavy equipment, medical equipment, and batteries for electric vehicles — which is an industry that China excels in, and is of strategic importance to the country. The data so far is less than encouraging. Only four companies have floated GDRs in London in the nearly three years after the Shanghai-London Connect went live; there has been no deal since October 2020. This means that Beijing still needs to make it a top priority to solve the ADR dispute with the US as soon as possible. While Hong Kong is quickly catching up, the US market — in particular the Nasdaq — is still the natural go-to choice for many Chinese companies, especially new economy firms. It is vital Mainland firms maintain access to the world’ s two biggest stock exchanges. A Swiss listing <span class="weasel">may</span> serve as a stopgap, but whether it can satiate the needs of Chinese companies for very long remains a question. The clock is ticking.</td>

          <td class="txt">Siemens made <span class="weasel">significant</span> progress as a focused technology company in the third quarter. The company leveraged growth opportunities in many key markets despite a continuing complex macroeconomic environment influenced by economic sanctions on Russia, high inflation and effects associated with the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, Siemens continued to avoid larger disruptions due to supply chain risks associated with electronics components, raw materials and logistics. Siemens continues to expect profitable growth of its Industrial Business to <span class="weasel">drive</span> basic earnings per share from net income before purchase price allocation accounting ( EPS pre PPA). Following the EUR2.7 billion non-cash impairment of the company's stake in Siemens Energy AG in the third quarter of the fiscal year, the guidance <span class="passive">is adjusted</span> to include the corresponding earnings impact of EUR3.37 per share, resulting in a range for EPS pre PPA of EUR5.33 to EUR5.73. This range represents Siemens ' original guidance for EPS pre PPA of EUR8.70 to EUR9.10, excluding this impairment. 'We captured <span class="weasel">significant</span> opportunities in a market environment with ongoing high demand. Our strong top line momentum continued, with a comparable order growth of 20 percent since the beginning of fiscal 2022. This shows: Our business is attractive and grew once again. We have the right offerings and the right strategy to be successful even in uncertain times, ' said Roland Busch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens AG. 'We made <span class="weasel">significant</span> progress as a focused technology company in the third quarter with the launch of our open digital business platform, Siemens Xcelerator, accelerating the digital transformation of our customers. We also acquired Brightly Software, an outstanding software-as-a-service player in the building space, which perfectly complements our leading position in smart buildings. ' 'Our continued top line momentum translated into a record, high-quality and high-quantity order backlog of EUR99 billion. We again achieved outstanding Free cash flow of EUR2.3 billion, which further underscored our financial strength. In addition, we consistently and successfully implemented our portfolio optimization and sharply accelerated our share buyback program, ' said Ralf P. Thomas, Chief Financial Officer of Siemens AG. Solid execution - outstanding Free cash flow In Q3, Siemens increased revenue 4 percent on a comparable basis - that is, excluding currency translation and portfolio effects - to EUR17.9 billion ( Q3 2021: EUR16.1 billion). Orders grew 1 percent on a comparable basis to EUR22.0 billion ( Q3 2021: EUR20.5 billion) and 20 percent on a comparable basis since the start of the fiscal year to EUR67.2 billion ( Q1-Q3 2021: EUR52.3 billion). At 1.23, the book-to-bill ratio was again at a high level. The order backlog totaled EUR99 billion - a new record and of a high quality. Profit Industrial Business climbed 27 percent to EUR2.9 billion ( Q3 2021: EUR2.3 billion), including a gain of EUR739 million from the sale of Yunex Traffic. The profit margin at the Industrial Business improved to 17.0 percent ( Q3 2021: 14.9 percent). The net loss totaled EUR1.5 billion ( net income in Q3 2021: a positive EUR1.5 billion). This decline was due to a EUR2.7 billion nontax-deductible impairment of the stake in Siemens Energy and Russia-related impacts totaling EUR0.6 billion. Corresponding basic earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocation accounting were a negative EUR1.85 ( Q3 2021: a positive EUR1.89). Excluding the burden relating to the impairment of the stake in Siemens Energy, they totaled a positive EUR1.52. At EUR2.3 billion, Free cash flow all-in from continuing and discontinued operations for the Siemens Group again reached an excellent level ( Q3 2021: EUR2.3 billion), with the Industrial Business posting strong Free cash flow of EUR2.5 billion ( Q3 2021: EUR2.4 billion). As a result, the strength of Siemens ' internal financing was also demonstrated once again in Q3. Strong growth at Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure At Digital Industries, orders increased by a total of 32 percent on a comparable basis across all businesses and regions to EUR6.5 billion due to ongoing growth momentum in key market segments. Revenue also rose by a total of 12 percent on a comparable basis in all business areas and regions to EUR4.9 billion, with the strongest growth contributions coming from the motion control and factory automation businesses. Profitability was held back primarily by shortages for high-margin electronics products and by lower revenue in the product lifecycle management business and higher expenses related to cloud-based activities, including the impact of the transition of parts of the business to software-as-a-service. At Smart Infrastructure, orders increased 26 percent on a comparable basis to EUR5.5 billion. Growth <span class="passive">was generated</span> across all businesses and in all three reporting regions, with a particularly strong contribution from the U.S., driven primarily by continuing strong demand for data centers. Revenue increased 10 percent on a comparable basis to EUR4.4 billion across all businesses, with the largest contribution from the electrical products business. On a geographic basis, growth was driven by the Americas and Europe, while revenue in China declined on a comparable basis due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Profit surged 31 percent to EUR562 million ( Q3 2021: EUR428 million). All businesses contributed to this strong performance, which was mainly due to higher revenue and greater capacity utilization as well as cost reductions achieved through the execution of the previously announced competitiveness program. The profit margin increased to 12.9 percent ( Q3 2021: 11.4 percent). Mobility won orders of EUR2.8 billion ( Q3 2021: EUR5.1 billion), whereby order intake in the prior-year quarter had been extraordinarily high due to a major order of EUR2.8 billion in the Americas. In Q3 2022, revenue rose 4 percent on a comparable basis to EUR2.5 billion ( Q3 2021: EUR2.3 billion), while profit of EUR704 million benefited primarily from a EUR739 million gain from the sale of Yunex. The profit margin climbed to 28.7 percent.

          <td class="txt">The whole world is celebrating the birth of vaccinations against COVID-19. Achieving widespread vaccination also poses a new challenge to countries’ health systems. To deliver the vaccines, SAP offered custom-developed systems that had already made their successful debut in Germany in early January. In order to achieve their large-scale immunization targets so that restrictions can be lifted, European countries face unprecedented challenges in terms of capabilities and coordinated operations. To <span class="weasel">support</span> their efforts, SAP created the SAP Vaccine Collaboration Hub system, provided with <span class="weasel">various</span> related software solutions. SAP Vaccine Collaboration Hub system ( VCH) covers the end-to-end process from manufacturing to controlled distribution to administration as well as post-vaccine monitoring. Through cloud-based applications and solutions from SAP, such as SAP Logistics Business Network, SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain, SAP S/4HANA, SAP Analytics Cloud, the VCH provides transparent insight into the vaccination process. 80% of global pharmaceutical manufacturers are customers of SAP, including 18 of the 20 global companies which are offering vaccines at the moment, rely on SAP ERP systems and softwares, including AstraZeneca, CureVac, GlaxoSmithKline Moderna, Pfizer and Sanofi. In addition, SAP has decades of experience in managing business processes, and existing digital solutions can be adapted to the specific requirements of the vaccination process with more or less modifications. „ Last year, with our Corona Warn-App contact research application, we have digitalized the process for successfully interrupting the chain of infection in view of the COVID-19 pandemic: from a possible infection to warning potential contact persons, from smartphones to laboratories. This year, we are focusing on a solution to help the vaccination process, and the good news is that our global digital solutions are available in the South East Europe region as well. Building on our experience and international best practices, our priority is to <span class="weasel">support</span> governments, healthcare institutions and other stakeholders in mitigating the effects of the pandemic ”, says Josephin Galla, Managing Director of SAP South East Europe. One of SAP’ s customers is German Red Cross, which is responsible for the next phase of the coronavirus control in Saxony, among others. In December, the province commissioned SAP to work with Telekom’ s subsidiary, T-Systems, to create a system that offers logistics and scheduling features for the vaccination. The collaboration created a solution that worked after a few weeks, so only the availability of an expandable amount of vaccine <span class="weasel">could</span> limit the vaccination process. “ Humanitarian logistics are a major challenge in the fight against the epidemic. SAP solutions allow us to digitize vaccine planning, procurement, inventory management and delivery ”, says Lars Werthmann of the German Red Cross ( DRK) in Saxony. The platform can track the availability of stocks and resources, the fulfillment of the planned pace, so that the entire logistics and distribution process can be planned and fine-tuned in real time, so the DRK is able to vaccinate citizens every day of the week.

Weltweit werden jedes Jahr etwa 121 Millionen Frauen ungewollt schwanger.1 Einer Studie aus dem Jahr 2019 zufolge besteht weltweit bei mehr als eine Milliarde Frauen Bedarf an Familienplanung, aber für 270 Millionen von ihnen ist der Bedarf hinsichtlich moderner Methoden der Familienplanung nicht gedeckt.2 * * Unabhängig von ihrem sozialen oder wirtschaftlichen Hintergrund kann eine ungeplante Schwangerschaft jede Frau überall treffen. „ Obwohl wir große Fortschritte im Bereich der reproduktiven Gesundheit verzeichnen, sind die Raten ungeplanter Schwangerschaften weltweit weiterhin hoch “, sagte Dr. Sandy Milligan, M.D., J.D., Leiterin der Forschung und Entwicklung bei Organon. „ Es gibt keinen besseren Zeitpunkt als vor dem Weltverhütungstag ( World Contraception Day), um Frauen durch Aufklärung, Information, Empathie und Gespräche zu stärken und damit ungewollte Schwangerschaften zu reduzieren. “ Organon lädt Frauen, ihre Familien, medizinisches Fachpersonal und politische Entscheidungsträger ein, unter https: //hereforherhealth.com/unplanned/ in einen Austausch darüber zu treten, wie die Rate ungeplanter Schwangerschaften gesenkt werden kann und gemeinsam mit uns in die Diskussion einzusteigen. „ Insbesondere zu diesem Zeitpunkt ist es entscheidend, den Schwerpunkt auf das reproduktive Wohlergehen aller Menschen zu legen “, sagte Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, MD, CEO von Power to Decide. „ Der Weltverhütungstag gibt uns die einmalige Gelegenheit zu unterstreichen, wie wichtig es ist, dass alle Menschen - unabhängig davon, wer sie sind, wo sie leben oder welchen wirtschaftlichen Hintergrund sie haben - die Möglichkeit haben zu entscheiden, ob, wann und unter welchen Umständen sie schwanger werden oder ein Kind bekommen wollen. “ Die PSA wird in den USA auf lokalen Fernseh- und Radiomärkten ausgestrahlt, über verschiedene weltweite Kanäle und Partner in Social Media verbreitet und steht unter https: //hereforherhealth.com/unplanned/ zur Verfügung, wo man gerne die eigenen Sichtweisen zur Verringerung ungeplanter Schwangerschaften teilen kann. Über Organon Organon ist ein globales Gesundheitsunternehmen, das durch die Ausgliederung aus Merck ( außerhalb der USA und Kanada als MSD bekannt) entstanden ist und sich auf die Verbesserung der Gesundheit von Frauen im Laufe ihres Lebens konzentriert. Das Unternehmen, das sich für die Gesundheit der Frau einsetzt, verfügt über ein Portfolio von mehr als 60 Arzneimitteln und Produkten in einer Reihe von Therapiebereichen. Die Produkte von Organon generieren - angeführt durch das Portfolio der reproduktiven Gesundheit, verbunden mit einem expandierenden Biosimilar-Geschäft und einem stabilen Franchising etablierter Arzneimittel - starke Zahlungsströme, die die Investitionen in Wachstumschancen für die Gesundheit der Frau in der Zukunft, einschließlich der Geschäftsentwicklung wie bei der kürzlich erworbenen Alydia Health, einem Medizintechnikunternehmen mit Schwerpunkt auf postpartaler Hämorrhagie, unterstützen werden. Organon nimmt zudem Gelegenheiten wahr, um mit innovativen Biopharmaunternehmen zusammenzuarbeiten, die nach Möglichkeiten suchen, ihre Produkte durch die Nutzung ihrer Reichweite und Präsenz in schnell wachsenden internationalen Märkten zu vermarkten. Organon ist durch seine schiere Größe und geografische Reichweite, seine erstklassigen Vermarktungsfähigkeiten und nahezu 9.000 Mitarbeiter global präsent.

          <td class="txt">SAP SE announces the availability of SAP Responsible Design and Production, a solution for designing products sustainably and transitioning to a circular economy. This is the latest offering in a growing portfolio of sustainability-specific software applications that help businesses increase their measurement and data management capabilities. As sustainable business regulations, such as plastic taxes, are put in place, the SAP Responsible Design and Production solution enables brands to accelerate their transition to circular-economy business practices. The new solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics. As businesses increasingly develop sustainable products, managing materials and regulatory data is becoming one of the most complex challenges across the consumer industry today. “ The circular economy <span class="passive">is based</span> on three principles, driven by design — eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature, ” said Andrew Morlet, CEO, Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “ Digital solutions play an important role in the transition to a circular economy. They <span class="weasel">enable</span> businesses to embed circular practices across their operations, from designing products to reduce waste from the outset, to tracking the lifecycle of the materials they use. ” With SAP’ s new solution, businesses can embed circularity principles into core business processes, helping eliminate waste and unlock new value by designing products to be sustainable from inception. For example, a shampoo brand manager has visibility into the full product lifecycle, including their extended producer responsibility ( EPR) obligations and the plastic taxes of different markets. This visibility helps the brand manager make design changes to reduce waste and decisions on how to lower the costs of the downstream reuse and recycling systems. “ Every year, we use almost twice the amount of resources than the planet can regenerate, ” said Scott Russell, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and head of Customer Success, “ Business can play a crucial role in keeping value in our systems for longer through smart, responsible product design that reuses resources rather than disposing of them. There is inherent complexity in designing products that eliminate waste and use responsible materials, but SAP Responsible Design and Production tackles that complexity and offers a ‘ gold-standard’ solution to our customers, helping to deliver circular products and achieve a regenerative economy. ” SAP Responsible Design and Production, a cloud-native solution co-developed with Accenture on SAP Business Technology Platform, provides tailored intelligence that enables businesses to keep pace with EPR regulations and plastic taxes, embed circularity principles into core business processes and optimize design for sustainable business.

          <td class="txt">Selena Gomez, I will not calm down — no matter how many times you ( or Taylor Swift) ask me to via song. The 30-year-old just released a teaser of the music video for “ Calm Down, ” her new collaboration with Nigerian Afrobeats star Rema, which <span class="passive">was released</span> on Thursday, August 25, at midnight. In the 12-second clip, which Gomez posted to TikTok on August 24, she wears a denim corset, pleated brown trousers, and gold hoops while leaning up against a vintage Porsche. She wears her waist-length hair wavy and parted in the center, and is it just me, or is this whole look straight out of the early '00s? This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Selena has been hinting at the project — which is a remix of a song off Rema’ s debut album — on social media, sharing videos of herself inside the recording studio.

          <td class="txt">One week after launching a dedicated CRISPR program, QIAGEN has partnered with San Diego-based Verogen to provide next-generation sequencing human identification workflows to laboratories in order to <span class="weasel">support</span> forensic efforts from justice departments across the globe. The two companies will collaborate to market Verogen’ s forensically validated next generation sequencing ( NGS) workflows alongside QIAGEN’ s full range of forensic-grade chemistries and sample prep automation to provide a full sample to ID solutions for human identification laboratories. Under the partnership, Germany-based QIAGEN will have rights to globally distribute both current and future Verogen products. Verogen’ s tools <span class="weasel">aim</span> to improve human identification beyond a DNA profile. Next generation sequencing is currently used in multiple biotech fields, including oncology research and testing for rare diseases. For the forensics field, NGS opens new opportunities to <span class="weasel">support</span> law enforcement efforts to solve missing person cases, criminal cases and victims of disasters. NGS provides additional capabilities, such as the estimation of externally visible characteristics like hair or eye color. The process elevates DNA testing from passive forensic <span class="weasel">support</span> to a proactive investigational technique. The partnership <span class="passive">is expected</span> to offer forensic clients a higher level of end-to-end <span class="weasel">support</span> across the globe, from sample collection to data interpretation and analysis. Verogen Chief Executive Officer Brett Williams said the partnership with QIAGEN will make it easier for laboratories to provide impactful answers and will allow for the accelerated adoption of next-generation sequencing ( NGS) in forensic operations. Thiery Bernard, QIAGEN’ s chief executive officer, said the partnership will combine Verogen’ s innovative NGS workflows with QIAGEN’ s portfolio of Sample to Insight solutions, which will create “ the most comprehensive product offering for forensics applications. ” He also said the partnership with Verogen will <span class="weasel">enable</span> customers to gain greater insights from their casework samples and <span class="weasel">drive</span> NGS adoption in human identification. He predicted the partnership will “ ultimately strengthen justice systems all over the world. ” The deal with Verogen comes one week after QIAGEN launched its QIAprep & CRISPR Kit and CRISPR Q-Primer Solutions program that allows researchers to more closely analyze edited genetic material to determine how gene editing interventions have changed the function of DNA sequences in question. The CRISPR kits mark the company’ s dedicated solutions for a fast-growing gene editing market. The company said the CRISPR products provide research teams with an “ all-in-one process ” for the characterization of “ so-called knock-outs generated from guide RNA ( gRNA) and knock-ins from small insertions during gene editing. ” Thomas Schweins, head of Life Sciences at QIAGEN, said the new CRISPR tools will reduce the time to result in gene editing experiments. Cell cultivation requirements will be reduced by seven days compared to existing methods, Schweins said. The process <span class="passive">is expected</span> to accelerate research in gene editing. “ They give a further boost to CRISPR’ s potential for breakthroughs in biomedical research into cancer, neurological conditions, gene therapy, cell therapy, immunotherapy, regenerative medicine, and disease modeling – and in the discovery of disease-signaling biomarkers and drug development, ” Schweins said in a statement.</td>

          <td class="txt">Europe's largest economy has passed legislation introducing a minimum quota for women on the boards of large listed companies, in a move widely praised by business diversity advocates as an important step toward gender equality. The German Federal Cabinet on Jan. 6 backed a bill which will mandate that large businesses, usually with more than 2,000 employees and at least three board positions, appoint at least one woman board member, as well as at least one man. Companies under the scope of the law include listed entities trading on the DAX index of Germany's largest companies, as well as those listed on other indices in Germany. The Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection said 70 listed companies <span class="passive">are affected</span>, 31 of which have no women on their boards. The bill, which still needs final legislative sign-off, also includes provisions for a further 90 companies in which the government has a substantial shareholding. These, such as state-owned railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG, will have to have at least 30% female representation in the boardroom. READ MORE: Sign up for our weekly ESG newsletter here, read our latest coverage of environmental, social and governance issues here and listen to our ESG podcast on SoundCloud, Spotify and Apple podcasts. Public service companies such as health insurance, pensions and accident insurers, and the Federal Agency for Employment will also need to have at least one woman on their boards. This will affect 155 entities. The underrepresentation of women and the best way to address it have been subject to fierce debate in politics and business in Germany for years. BDI, the umbrella trade organization for German industry, said in a Jan. 6 email that it backs the political <span class="weasel">aim</span> of supporting the appointment of women to leadership posts, but calls for a balanced sharing of responsibilities and a flexible transition for companies. `` The introduction of a fixed board quota remains a special challenge for the economy. It is a <span class="weasel">significant</span> intervention into business freedom. The tendency to always try to solve societal inequalities through the economy and businesses can not become the rule, '' said Iris Plöger, a member of the BDI executive board. The decision, when transposed into law, will make Germany one of the few countries in Europe with mandates on gender for company boards. Neighboring France has already exceeded its 40% legislative target of women on boards, set in 2011, for its largest businesses. The U.K. has a voluntary initiative for raising the representation of women in boardrooms, with the independent Hampton-Alexander Review saying in February 2020 that the FTSE 100 index had reached its targeted 33% of female board representation — at 349 out of 1046 directorships — a year ahead of its deadline. In the U.S., Californian companies are also mandated to ensure female board representation. At an EU-level, a planned Women on Boards Directive was meant to put legislative meat on the bone of the European Commission's general <span class="weasel">support</span> for boosting female board membership. The initiative has not progressed through parliament. Diversity 'milestone ' reached, but heavy lifts still ahead Back in Germany, there is hope that the quota delivers what guidance has so far failed to achieve. Monika Schulz-Strelow, president of think-tank FidAR, which tracks the share of women in Germany's boardrooms, described the legislation as `` another milestone on the way to equal participation. '' However, she noted that its scope <span class="passive">is limited</span>, and will only apply from 2022 and to new board appointments. `` But the signaling effect is enormous: [ it tells business ] to stop favoring men. In the past few years the increase of female representation has stalled. Now I am anticipating a new dawn, '' she said. FidAR has compiled a list of the companies affected by the new law, finding <span class="weasel">around</span> 30 who do not yet have a woman on their board. Companies from a range of sectors fall short of the new requirement, but many businesses without female board members are in heavy industry. Chemicals giant Bayer AG and energy company Uniper SE currently do not have women on their boards; nor do insurer Talanx AG and finance group Wüstenrot & Württembergische AG. `` Look at the DAX-30 company HeidelbergCement AG. No woman on the seven-person board, a target of zero, '' Schulz-Strelow said. In anticipation of the law's approval, there has already been a shift in German boardrooms. Sportswear maker adidas AG and energy giant E.ON SE both appointed women to their boards in recent weeks, in the fields of human resources and digitalization, respectively. Under the new law, companies who do not appoint female board members will need to justify and report on why that is, and those who do not set a target for boardroom diversity can be sanctioned more effectively in the future. `` Without an explanation, this can get very expensive for companies. Companies will now think twice, '' Schulz-Strelow said.</td>

This <span class="passive">is contrasted</span> by a supply situation that remains very tight, '' said Infineon CEO Reinhard Ploss. `` Inventories are at an all-time low, and our chips are going from production directly into end applications. '' Ploss went on to say that the company is currently having its products virtually snatched out of its hands. `` Inventories are at an all-time low, our chips are going from manufacturing directly into end-use applications, '' Ploss said. Nevertheless, Infineon remained below its means. This is because the Infineon plant in Melaka, Malaysia, which is responsible for testing and packaging in the group's value chain, was at times unable to use its full capacity because of the Corona pandemic. What would have been possible in this quarter, in which the entire semiconductor industry is producing and selling at full speed, is shown by the recently published quarterly figures of NXP and STMicroelectronics: the two competitors were able to increase their sales by more than 40% each. So Ploss had no choice but to vow improvement. `` We are doing our utmost at all stages of the value chain and are acting as flexibly as possible for the benefit of our customers. In addition, we are continuously providing additional capacities, '' said the CEO. The ATV ( automotive) division, Infineon's strongest segment in terms of sales, was also hit by the restrictions in manufacturing. Car manufacturers are currently desperately seeking sources of supply for semiconductor components; tens of thousands of vehicles can not be built because the chips are missing. However, Infineon was not able to benefit from this situation; sales of automotive components fell by 1 percent in the quarter under review compared to the previous quarter to €1.2 billion. Compared to the same quarter of the previous year, however, sales rose by 49 percent,</td>

          <td class="txt">Louise Cooney has over 214k followers on Instagram. With nearly 2m users nationwide, from President Higgins to Bono, it’ s safe to say that Instagram has penetrated nearly every aspect of Irish life. For <span class="weasel">some</span>, the social media platform has even become a way of making a living, with brands doling out millions to popular users for promotion on their pages. Earnings can be pretty high for homegrown beauties here in Ireland, with users like Suzanne Jackson and Rosie Connolly thought to make as much as €1000 per sponsored post. ‘ My life changed overnight '  Cork’ s Nicole O’ Brien, however, <span class="weasel">could</span> put them all to shame, with one post to her 826k followers making her $ 4,000 this year. “ I think paid content is totally acceptable if influencers do it the right way. I only work with brands I like and trust. Everything I post I <span class="weasel">believe</span> in, ” the 25-year-old says. She skyrocketed to fame last year after appearing on Netflix's Too Hot to Handle, which <span class="passive">was viewed</span> by over 64 million households worldwide. “ My life changed completely overnight. It went from zero to 100 so quickly I couldn’ t <span class="weasel">believe</span> it. There was a point where I gained up to 65k followers a day, ” she says. The constant notifications made her nervous at first. The Innishannon native had been working as a sales executive in London before the show aired, having moved two years ago following her graduation from UCC. She quickly got used to the attention, however, and has tried to use it in a positive way, setting up a self-help platform called IAmLovd.com with a group of expert psychologists. “ It made me feel a lot of anxiety at first as so many eyes were on me and I didn’ t know how to perceive myself on social media. I then decided to just be myself and share my ups and downs with everyone. I wanted to be totally transparent and people loved it, ” she says. “ Instagram is essentially how I make most of my money now, it’ s my source of income. I’ ve <span class="passive">been voted</span> the top influencer in Ireland which has been mad. Looking back at just one year ago, I was working in an office. ” Irish eyes  Nicole made headlines a few months ago when Zalando named her the highest-earning Irish influencer, estimating her earnings at €422k, which isn’ t an accurate figure. She is very careful about the brands she works with, only ever promoting products she believes in. “ I first realised I <span class="weasel">could</span> make Instagram a job just two days after the show aired. I had big brand deals coming in from the likes of Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing, and MissyEmpire, ” she says. “ Instagram has brought me amazing work opportunities. I’ ve had my own clothing line edit with WearWhatSheWore. I’ ve also been able to attend events and meet <span class="weasel">some</span> amazing people. ” Her main focus at the moment, however, is her music career and rebranding herself as an artist. She just launched her first single Irish Eyes under the name Kole, which hit number one on the iTunes charts. “ I’ ve wanted to work in the industry since I was a teenager and I’ m a firm believer that you can do anything you put your mind to. I always had it in my mind that I wanted to do TV and influencing and then gradually get into music from there, ” she says. The hard part, however, is constantly being in the public eye. “ It can be a blessing and a curse. I love chatting to people from all over the world but with that, you also get opinions from a lot of people about certain things. It’ s really important to have thick skin if you want to have a big profile on social media. I’ m lucky that nothing phases me anymore but people have to be wary of that. There is a negative view of influencers online and I think it’ s gotten worse. ” ‘ A constant hustle’  Since Louise Cooney first set up her website in 2015, her name has become synonymous with fashion blogging in Ireland. For her 214k Instagram followers, you just don't talk about Irish Instagram pages without mentioning Louise, who recently tracked her move back to Ireland from New York City for her followers. Returning to the family home would be a shock to any 28-year-old's system, but especially for someone who left her job in 2017 to make a full-time living out of online content creation. The following eight months in her native Limerick was the longest time she had spent at home since leaving to study communications in DCU at 17. `` At the time I didn't really know what I was going to do or what avenue I was going to go down but being creative, writing, taking photos, putting ideas together; that's what I 've always really loved and that's exactly what I do for my job, ” Louise says over the phone from her new Dublin city apartment. She first moved to the big apple after receiving her MA degree to study as a graduate student with Tourism Ireland. Writing about fashion was a no-brainer for Louise, who spent her childhood ripping pages out of magazines. On top of running her blog, she also worked as a correspondent for Teen Vogue and studied a fashion course at Parsons School of Design. `` It was a constant hustle for years, '' she says. `` The thing is though when it's something that you love, it doesn't feel like work. The opportunities it opened up for me were so worth it. '' After a year, however, the then 24-year-old <span class="passive">was forced</span> to make a tough choice. `` It just got to a point where I had to make a decision about [ blogging ] full-time or giving it up because I just couldn't keep doing both. So I said: Look I get to travel, I can get all these really cool opportunities, even if it only lasts a couple of years. Why not? '' Louise saved up six months ' worth of living expenses and gave up her job, a `` calculated risk '' as she calls it. `` I 'm a little bit of a worrier. You just have to have a lot of faith in what you do though. '' She's learned a lot since, from simple things like which months are busiest ( December) to how to do her taxes ( not so easy to figure out). She also had to learn to block out the many verbal bullets aimed at women online.</td>

          <td class="txt">It comes with the additional cost of $ 2500.00 contact sales. The global barefoot shoes market <span class="passive">was valued</span> at $ 471.1 million in 2021, and <span class="passive">is projected</span> to reach $ 788.7 million by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2022 to 2031. According to the Indian Shoe Federation, the global footwear demand <span class="passive">was expected</span> to fall by 27% in Europe, 21% in North America, and 20% in Asia-Pacific. Major markets such as Europe and North America were worst hit by the pandemic and their imports of tennis shoes and other sports footwear declined significantly. A barefoot shoe has a zero heel-to-toe drop, which means the entire foot is on the same level as the ground same as barefoot. These shoes allow the foot to land on the ground almost as if one is running barefoot: they do little more than provide grip and protect feet against harmful objects on the ground. <span class="weasel">Some</span> <span class="passive">are designed</span> to help the consumers transition from heel-first running to barefoot-style running. The shoes <span class="passive">were introduced</span> with the <span class="weasel">aim</span> to strengthen and let the foot grow at an actual pace. A minimalist type of shoe <span class="weasel">could</span> be beneficial for an experienced runner or active walker who wants to take it to the next level. Large population size, coupled with a rise in disposable income is among the major factors that boost demand for high-end footwear in developing markets. An increase in sales through online channels, innovative product launches, attractive marketing, and promotional strategies are other factors <span class="passive">are expected</span> to propel the barefoot shoes market demand. An increase in environmental concerns and a rise in the prices of raw materials are the major challenges for players operating in the market. However, the market <span class="passive">is anticipated</span> to unfold attractive business opportunities, owing to changes in consumer lifestyles and an increase in penetration of online retailing. Consumers are becoming more health conscious due to work-related stress and lifestyle disorders. Thus, the increase in the number of health-conscious consumers has created a strong demand for athletic sportswear and footwear, which, in turn, augments the growth of the overall market. Moreover, the rise in the trend of fashionable sports apparel propels the growth of the market. Furthermore, continuous innovations in sportswear and footwear notably contribute to the growth of the market. However, an increase in the inclination of kids toward indoor leisure activities <span class="passive">is expected</span> to hamper the growth of the market during the forecast period. On the contrary, an increase in the participation of women in sports <span class="passive">is anticipated</span> to offer remunerative opportunities for the expansion of the market in the future. The availability of fake and low-priced products restricts the growth of the market. Sportswear and footwear by renowned brands have a high price range, which is not affordable for lower-income groups. Hence, local suppliers design the same style of products at comparatively lower costs. Such products are of low quality and hamper the brand image of forerunners in the market, thereby limiting sales of original products. The availability of counterfeit or low-quality sportswear and footwear restricts sales of branded products, thus threatening the barefoot shoes market growth. Hectic work schedules and growth in the number of health-related issues are encouraging people to adopt daily exercise routines, such as jogging, gym, and yoga. This has increased demand for the barefoot shoes. Moreover, the rising obesity rate among the global population is also expected to increase the population’ s concern about fitness activity. According to the World Health Organization ( WHO), worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. This huge rise in the population suffering from obesity is grabbing consumers’ attention toward fitness which <span class="passive">is expected</span> to boost the growth of the barefoot shoes industry. The initiative being taken by the government towards the participation of youth in sports <span class="passive">is expected</span> to surge the growth of the market. For instance, the National Youth Sports Strategy aims to unite U.S. youth sports culture <span class="weasel">around</span> a shared vision that one day all youth of the country will have the opportunity, motivation, and access to play sports. Along with these the rising government investments in the Olympics and other sports events are also expected to boost the growth of the barefoot shoes market size. Rubber, leather, and mesh are the main raw materials, used for the manufacturing of barefoot shoes. There has been a continuous rise in prices of raw materials such as rubber and synthetic foam in past few years. The prices of raw materials directly affect the production cost of products, thereby leading to an increase in the market price of finished products. This acts as a restraint for the barefoot shoes industry. Change in consumer lifestyle in developing countries due to urbanization has led to an increase in demand for new and fashionable products. This provides manufacturers with an opportunity to launch new and innovative products and increase their market size. For instance, in India, urbanization is taking place at a dramatic pace and is influencing the lifestyle and buying behavior of consumers. The increase in the number of people involved in gyms, jogging, and other such activities has increased sales of barefoot shoes in India. E-commerce <span class="passive">is expected</span> to act as an opportunity for market players in the coming years. E-commerce has a large number of benefits, including speed of access and a wider selection of goods and services. E-commerce is gaining traction in most countries as demand for online goods is increasing. The rise in penetration of the internet and smartphones has been the major growth factor for e-commerce. Moreover, apart from the outlets, e-commerce has become a necessity for players to increase their sales and consumer base globally. Researchers from a university in Johannesburg, South Africa compared modern humans from different populations to the feet of 2,000-year-old skeletons and concluded that, before shoes, people had healthier stronger feet. Another study compared the feet of South African and German children and found those who regularly went barefoot had healthier feet ( higher overall arches and straighter big toes) than the ( European) shoe-wearers. The regularly barefoot also presented with fewer foot characteristics like flat feet and deformed big toes and bunions, as well as more flexible, pliable feet. Such advantages of barefoot shoes are attracting consumers’ attention towards it which <span class="passive">is expected</span> to boost the growth of the market. The barefoot shoes market <span class="passive">is segmented</span> on the basis of end-user, shoe closure type, distribution channel, and region. By end-user, the market <span class="passive">is categorized</span> into men, women, and kids. By shoe closure type, the market <span class="passive">is classified</span> into buckle, lace-up, zipper, and others. By distribution channel, the market <span class="passive">is segmented</span> into hypermarkets, specialty stores, brand outlets, and e-commerce. Region-wise, the market <span class="passive">is analyzed</span> across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA. On the basis of end-user, the barefoot shoes market is further segmented into men, women, and kids. The men segment dominated the global market and <span class="passive">is expected</span> to retain its dominance during the barefoot shoes market forecast period. Men actively participate in sporting and recreational activities. A consistent increase in the participation of men in outdoor sports <span class="passive">is expected</span> to <span class="weasel">support</span> the growth of the barefoot shoes market size during the forecast period. On the basis of shoe closure type, the barefoot shoes market is further bifurcated into buckle, lace-up, zipper, and others. The buckle segment constitutes a major barefoot shoes market share. Buckles as shoe closures were initially used by Roman soldiers to fasten armor and for decorative purposes too. Over the years, buckles have come in and out of fashion. Still one can see buckles on shoes; however, they’ re usually used with a strip of leather. On the basis of distribution channels, the barefoot shoes market <span class="passive">is categorized</span> into hypermarkets, specialty stores, brand outlets, and e-commerce. The hypermarket segment <span class="passive">is projected</span> to dominate the market accounting for more than 38.71% share in 2031 growing at a <span class="weasel">significant</span> CAGR of 5.9% from 2022 to 2031. An increase in the availability of barefoot shoes through hypermarkets along with specialists’ advice <span class="passive">is expected</span> to boost sales through these distribution channels.

          <td class="txt">VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 04, 2022 ( GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- General Fusion announced today the formation of a unique Market Development Advisory Committee ( MDAC) to guide the development of its commercial fusion power plant. MDAC members include utilities serving millions of customers, innovative renewable energy providers, and companies leading the decarbonization of heavy industry. These companies span global markets in need of carbon-free, on-demand power to meet increasingly ambitious net-zero carbon emission policy goals. Many bring extensive expertise in evaluating, deploying, and operating commercial power generation assets. General Fusion’ s global network of investors and government, institutional, and industrial partners <span class="weasel">enable</span> the company to pursue a more ambitious fusion technology commercialization program. Through the MDAC, General Fusion is proactively engaging the market to form a portfolio of prospective early fusion adopters to ensure that the performance and specifications of its Magnetized Target Fusion power plant will <span class="weasel">align with</span> customer needs. The MDAC benefits its membership by providing a mechanism to monitor the development of General Fusion’ s technology, understand when and how to include fusion in their new energy generation plans, guide the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks, and influence the company’ s future product development. Launched with nearly a dozen member companies spanning North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, the MDAC will <span class="weasel">support</span> General Fusion in designing a practical and compelling fusion power plant that can be deployed by the early 2030s. The MDAC will also recommend and <span class="weasel">support</span> opportunities to evolve public energy policies promoting the early adoption of commercial fusion power plants as part of the energy transition to net-zero carbon. “ Now is the time to develop the global market for fusion energy. Companies are increasingly recognizing that to achieve their net-zero mandates and aspirations, they’ re going to need fusion, ” said Christofer Mowry, CEO, General Fusion. “ Our Market Development Advisory Committee will help guide General Fusion in addressing this need using a partnership and collaboration strategy. ” “ Bruce Power <span class="passive">is committed</span> to advancing a net-zero future and clean energy technologies that are essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ” said Richard Horrobin, Vice President, Business Development & Energy Innovation, Bruce Power. “ Fusion is a key emerging technology that is complementary to the emissions-free electricity we produce. We look forward to applying our experience and expertise in innovation, clean energy production, and policy development to collaborate with General Fusion. ” “ The path to net-zero means developing new sources of clean energy and reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels, which is all the more important given the current issues in global energy markets and the situation in Ukraine, ” said Michael Lewis, CEO, E.ON UK. “ Energy-intensive industrial customers particularly will need alternative technologies if they are to meet net-zero targets and remain competitive in their own markets, and as the UK’ s largest electricity provider, we <span class="passive">are pleased</span> to have the opportunity to work with General Fusion to look at how the market for their products <span class="weasel">could</span> evolve in the UK and develop a new way to take action for the climate. ” “ H2 Green Steel is on a mission to undertake the global steel industry’ s greatest ever technological shift, ” said Henrik Henriksson, CEO, H2 Green Steel. “ That’ s why we are teaming up with General Fusion to <span class="weasel">explore</span> the global scalability of our technology, not limited by in-country power generation constraints. Fusion energy has the potential to accelerate the decarbonization of steel production. We look forward to working together with General Fusion on the practical application of fusion energy in heavy industry. ” “ Specializing in renewable energy, pioneering sustainable and innovative technologies is in our DNA, ” said Riccardo Toto, General Manager, Renexia. “ That is why we have joined General Fusion’ s international committee, to <span class="weasel">support</span> bringing clean fusion energy technology to market. We will represent the Italian energy sector on the committee. We hope that fusion energy will soon represent a further opportunity to <span class="weasel">promote</span> an energy mix less dependent on fossil fuels. ” “ Nuclear power currently provides over 40% of the electric energy TVA produces for the people and businesses we serve in seven states, ” said Joe Hoagland, Vice President for Innovation & Research, Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA). “ Developing advanced nuclear and other technologies is important for TVA’ s energy system of the future. The recent <span class="weasel">support</span> of the United States Congress for public-private partnerships that promise to accelerate the growth of fusion is encouraging. We will continue exploring business relationships to innovate new clean-energy technologies in <span class="weasel">support</span> of TVA’ s aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. ” General Fusion's Magnetized Target Fusion removes the traditional technological barriers to delivering economical fusion power plants. The company recently reached a critical technology milestone, demonstrating the advanced engineering capabilities needed to scale its compression prototype to a full power system. Later in 2022, the company anticipates celebrating another milestone when it breaks ground on its Fusion Demonstration Plant at the UK Atomic Energy Authority’ s Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. The Fusion Demonstration Plant will create the template for General Fusion's first commercial power plant. It will confirm the performance and economics of the company's technology at a power-plant-relevant scale. About General FusionGeneral Fusion pursues a fast, efficient, and collaborative path to practical fusion power. We are completing an aggressive development <span class="weasel">plan to</span> deliver economical carbon-free fusion energy with our proprietary Magnetized Target Fusion technology by the 2030s. Our mission <span class="passive">is supported</span> by a global syndicate of leading institutional investors, venture capital firms, and technology pioneers, together with governments across North America and Europe. General Fusion collaborates with a global network of partners to create a sustainable future built on cleaner energy, better materials, and a comprehensive life cycle approach to the world’ s infrastructure. Founded in 2002, we <span class="passive">are headquartered</span> in Vancouver, Canada, with additional centers co-located with internationally recognized fusion research laboratories near London, U.K., and in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, U.S.A.

          <td class="txt">The error was due to a miscommunication with ATC and saw the aircraft descend too low to the ground before reaching the runway threshold. On <span class="weasel">May</span> 23 this year, an AirHub Airbus A320 operating on behalf of Norwegian from Stockholm Arlanda to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport descended below safe height on approach - twice. The event, labeled a `` serious incident '' by the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety ( BEA), <span class="passive">was caused</span> by an incorrect altimeter setting. As reported by The Aviation Herald, the aircraft, a 22-year-old Airbus A320-200 registered as 9H-EMU, was operating flight D8-4311 from Stockholm Arlanda ( ARN) to Paris Charles de Gaulle ( CDG) and on a Required Navigation Performance ( RNP) approach to CDG's runway 27R. However, the crew had selected the wrong pressure indication for the altimeter. Instead of QNH 1001hPa, the approach controller had told them 1011 Pa. As such, the plane was coming in at 250 feet below the glide path. This triggered a Minimum Safe Altitude Warning ( MSAW). The crew initiated a low-altitude go-<span class="weasel">around</span> at about 1NM before the runway threshold without having acquired visual contact with the ground. The aircraft reached a minimum of 405 feet according to QNH 1001hPa, which according to the QNH 1011 hPa setting would have read 679 feet. According to the AV Herald, the radio altimeter indicated six feet above ground level. After contact with the control tower, the plane climbed back to 5,000 feet and circled <span class="weasel">around</span> for another attempt. However, the error with the altimeter settings was not discovered or communicated. As such, the aircraft was again coming in too low for its second approach, and another MSAW alarm <span class="passive">was triggered</span>, 3.1NM before the runway threshold. Fortunately, on this occasion, the pilots established visual contact with the ground and pitched up to correct the trajectory of the plane. The aircraft landed safely 16 minutes after the go-<span class="weasel">around</span> at 13:58. No terrain awareness and warning system ( TAWS) alarm, which <span class="passive">is intended</span> to prevent unintentional impacts of an aircraft with the ground, went off during the incident. Simple Flying has reached out to both Norwegian and the wet lease operator. At the time of publication, only the Scandinavian low-cost carrier had responded to a request for comment with the following statement, `` We <span class="passive">are committed</span> to ensuring a safe operation and all the companies we wet lease from are European airlines, approved by European and Norwegian aviation authorities. These companies follow European safety regulations, in the same way as Norwegian. We are now in dialogue with the airline regarding the situation. '' GetJet Airlines is a Lithuanian airline group which includes Airhub Airlines based in Malta. While the former has a mixed fleet, the latter operates an all-Airbus fleet of nine aircraft. This consists of three Airbus A320-200, two A330-300, one A330-900, and three A340-300. It will soon take two more used A320s and one A340. The A320-200 involved in the incident <span class="passive">is leased</span> from the mainline carrier, where it used to be registered as LY-FOX. Have you ever flown on GetJet or its subsidiary? Or have you experienced a go-<span class="weasel">around</span>, either from the flight deck or as a passenger? What was your experience? Leave a comment below and share your story.

          <td class="txt">BackgroundThe incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK decreased by <span class="weasel">approximately</span> four times from 1999 to 2014, with reductions in serogroup C and serogroup B disease. Lower serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease incidence was attributable to implementation of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine in 1999, through direct and indirect protection, but no vaccine <span class="passive">was implemented</span> against serogroup B disease. UK Meningococcal Carriage surveys 1–3 ( UKMenCar1–3), conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001, were essential for understanding the impact of vaccination. To investigate the decline in invasive meningococcal disease incidence, we did a large oropharyngeal carriage survey in 2014–15, immediately before the changes to meningococcal vaccines in the UK national immunisation schedule.MethodsUKMenCar4 was a cross-sectional survey in adolescents aged 15–19 years who <span class="passive">were enrolled</span> from schools and colleges geographically local to one of 11 UK sampling centres between Sept 1, 2014, and March 30, 2015.

Carriage prevalence was substantially lower in UKMenCar4 than in the previous surveys: carriage prevalence was 16·6% ( 95% CI 15·89–17·22; 2306/13 901) in UKMenCar1 ( 1999), 17·6% ( 17·05–18·22; 2873/16 295) in UKMenCar2 ( 2000), and 18·7% ( 18·12–19·27; 3283/17 569) in UKMenCar3 ( 2001).

The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK decreased by <span class="weasel">approximately</span> four times from 1999 to 2014, with reductions in serogroup C and serogroup B disease. Lower serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease incidence was attributable to implementation of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine in 1999, through direct and indirect protection, but no vaccine <span class="passive">was implemented</span> against serogroup B disease. UK Meningococcal Carriage surveys 1–3 ( UKMenCar1–3), conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001, were essential for understanding the impact of vaccination. To investigate the decline in invasive meningococcal disease incidence, we did a large oropharyngeal carriage survey in 2014–15, immediately before the changes to meningococcal vaccines in the UK national immunisation schedule.

Research in contextEvidence before this studyMany pharyngeal carriage studies have analysed meningococci circulating in the population, and have furthered understanding of meningococcal epidemiology and transmission. In high-income settings, carriage prevalence is highest in adolescents, who <span class="weasel">drive</span> transmission in the wider population.

These surveys showed MCC vaccine-induced herd immunity against the epidemic strain ( serogroup C, clonal complex 11) among adolescents. This herd immunity affected the transmission of clonal complex 11 meningococci and protected unvaccinated people.

This study is similar to previous studies ( UKMenCar1–3), which were done with the same methods but at a time of high disease incidence. Invasive meningococcal disease cases declined steadily between 1999 and 2014, including disease caused by serogroups not targeted by the MCC vaccine. We showed that adolescent carriage rates more than halved, from 16·7–18·7% in 1999–2001 to 7·2% in 2014–15. Risk factors for carriage were similar between UKMenCar1 and UKMenCar4, but adolescent participation in these risk factors declined, with fewer students in UKMenCar4 than in UKMenCar1 reporting active or passive smoking, intimate kissing, and attendance at pubs or nightclubs. This cross-sectional, observational study also reports baseline meningococcal carriage prevalence, stratified by serogroup and clonal complex, before the introduction into the UK national immunisation schedules of a conjugate polysaccharide vaccine against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y for adolescents, and protein-based capsular group B vaccines for infants. This long-term ecological study is, therefore, a reference point for the UK Be on the Team study ( EudraCT number 2017–004609–42), a meningococcal carriage survey ongoing at the time of writing.Implications of all the available evidenceThis study illustrates the importance of understanding the epidemiology of meningococcal carriage in relation to disease and the potential for intervention. We showed the long-term effects of the MCC vaccine programme, with carriage rates of serogroup C meningococci among adolescents decreasing rapidly after MCC vaccine implementation and persisting at low levels 15 years later. Our observation that social behaviour and practices known to enhance meningococcal carriage have declined alongside carriage prevalence provides a plausible explanation for declining rates of the disease. Our results further suggest that public health policies aimed at influencing behaviour are <span class="weasel">likely</span> to affect the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease.

The sample size of the study <span class="passive">was established</span> by the ability to detect rare meningococcal strains ( defined here as strains with a 1% prevalence). Assuming a 17% overall carriage prevalence ( based on UKMenCar1–3), with 18 000 participants, we would expect to detect 3060 meningococci in total, and for rare strains at 1%, we would have a reasonably precise 95% CI of 0·85–1·15%.

Between Sept 1, 2014, and March 30, 2015, 21 893 students <span class="passive">were recruited</span> across 11 UK centres. Oropharyngeal swabs <span class="passive">were prepared</span> for culture from 21 726 eligible students, of which 2085 participants ' swabs <span class="passive">were excluded</span> as they were unable to be processed after shipping ( n=467) or they <span class="passive">were stored</span> in incorrectly manufactured STGG broth ( n=1618; appendix p 2). In total, 19 641 students ' swabs and their corresponding risk-factor questionnaires <span class="passive">were included</span> in the analysis. The demographic characteristics of these students <span class="passive">are summarised</span> in the appendix ( p 6). The proportion of the UK national birth cohort in school years 12 and 13 who <span class="passive">were enrolled</span> into UKMenCar4 was 1·74%; this sample was representative demographically of the entire population of that age in the UK in 2014–16 ( appendix p 6). Of 19 641 participants, 1420 had N meningitidis isolated, 246 had putative Neisseria spp isolated, and 17 975 had no Neisseria spp isolated ( appendix p 2). Carriage prevalence of meningococci was 7·23% ( 95% CI 6·88–7·60; 1420/19 641) in UKMenCar4, 16·6% ( 95% CI 15·89–17·22; 2306/13 901) in UKMenCar1 ( 1999), 17·6% ( 17·05–18·22; 2873/16 295) in UKMenCar2 ( 2000), and 18·7% ( 18·12–19·27; 3283/17 569) in UKMenCar3 ( 2001). Rates for the individual centres ranged from 1·5% to 13·1% ( appendix pp 3–4), with variation between centres similar to that observed in UKMenCar1–3. Neisseria lactamica <span class="passive">was carried</span> by 225 ( 1·15%, 95% CI 1·00–1·30) of 19 641 participants in UKMenCar4, compared with 132 ( 0·95% 0·80–1·12) of 13 901 in 1999. Other commensal Neisseria spp confirmed by ribosomal MLST included Neisseria subflava ( 15 isolates; carriage prevalence ( 0·08%, 95% CI 0·04–0·12), Neisseria polysaccharea ( three isolates; 0·02%, 0·004–0·040), Neisseria cinerea ( two isolates; 0·01%, 0·002–0·030), and Neisseria bergeri ( one isolate, ( 0·005%, 0·0003–0·0300). 41 ( 0·21%) of 19 641 swabs with putative Neisseria spp <span class="weasel">could</span> not be re-cultured for serological testing or DNA extraction for WGS, so they are not included in the putative Neisseria spp isolates. Meningococcal carriage rate by age group showed an increasing trend from 15 years old to 18–19 years old, both in 1999 and in 2014–15 ( figure 2A; appendix pp 6 and 8); however, the age-specific carriage rates were significantly lower in UKMenCar4 in every age group than in UKMenCar1 ( 1999), reflecting the overall decline in carriage ( figure 2A). The age-specific ORs for carriage were similar for each age group between 1999 and 2014–15, and ORs increased with increasing age ( figure 2B, appendix p 7).Figure 2Carriage rates and odds ratios for carriage by ageShow full caption ( A) Oropharyngeal carriage rates for adolescents aged 15–19 years in the UK for UKMenCar1 in 1999 ( 2306 meningococci isolates from 13 901 participants) and UKMenCar4 in 2014–15 ( 1420 meningococci isolates from 19 641 participants).

Meningococcal isolates belonged to 29 clonal complexes, with clonal complexes for 94 ( 7%) of 1420 isolates not categorised because of incomplete MLST profiles or belonging to sequence types not yet assigned to clonal complexes ( appendix p 5). Nine clonal complexes accounted for 1066 ( 75%) of 1420 isolates ( figure 4), with measured carriage prevalence in 19 641 samples of 1·53% ( 95% CI 1·37–1·71; n=301) for clonal complex 23, 0·79% ( 0·68–0·92; n=156) for clonal complex 1157, 0·65% ( 0·55–0·77; n=128) for clonal complex 53, 0·59% ( 0·49–0·71; n=116) for clonal complex 41/44, 0·51% ( 0·42–0·62; n=101) for clonal complex 213, 0·51% ( 0·42–0·62; n=100) for clonal complex 198, 0·37% ( 0·29–0·47; n=73) for clonal complex 11, 0·26% ( 0·20–0·34; n=52) for clonal complex 269, and 0·17% ( 0·12–0·24; n=33) for clonal complex 22.

Of the hyperinvasive lineages, clonal complex 23 had a relative carriage prevalence ratio ( 2014–15 to 1999) of 5·37 ( 95% CI 4·29–6·73) and clonal complex 11 had a ratio of 2·76 ( 1·90–4·00). <span class="weasel">Significant</span> reductions <span class="passive">were observed</span> in the relative carriage prevalence ( 2014–15 to 1999) of clonal complexes 41/44 ( rate ratio 0·54, 95% CI 0·44–0·66) and 22 ( 0·20, 0·14–0·28) meningococci from UKMenCar1 to UKMenCar4.Figure 4Distribution of meningococcal clonal complexes in UKMenCar1–4 surveysShow full captionProportions of the nine most frequently occurring clonal complexes of meningococci are shown for the four UKMenCar studies.

UKMenCar=UK Meningococcal Carriage. Invasive meningococcal disease incidence measured across all age groups, changed from 1999 to 2014–15 for each disease-associated serogroup, coincident with fluctuations in clonal complex distribution ( figure 4) and adolescent carriage of these clonal complexes ( figure 3). Serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease steadily declined from 1999 to 2014–15, with a shift in the predominant clonal complex carried by adolescents from clonal complex 41/44 to clonal complex 213 ( figure 4). Rates of group C invasive meningococcal disease declined rapidly after MCC introduction in 1999, coincident with a decrease in genogroup C carriage and elimination from carriage of genogroup C clonal complex 11 by 2014–15 ( figure 3). For genogroup W, the predominant clonal complex carried by adolescents switched from clonal complex 22 in UKMenCar1–3 to clonal complex 11 in UKMenCar4 ( figure 3), which was coincident with increasing serogroup W disease ( figure 1 and 3). For genogroup Y, the predominant clonal complex in UKMenCar4 was clonal complex 23, whereas clonal complex 167 predominated in 1999 ( figure 3). The proportion of adolescents self-reporting as regular smokers decreased by 47·9% from 1999 ( 21·5%; 2932/13 650) to 2014–15 ( 11·2%; 2202/19 641; p < 0·0001), although the small proportion of heavy smokers ( > 20 cigarettes per day) <span class="passive">was unchanged</span> ( 0·3%, 46/13 650 in 1999 vs 0·3%, 55/19 641 in 2014–15; p=0·41).

Attendance at pubs and nightclubs fell by 37·2% in 1999 ( 62·1%; 8436/13 594) to 2014–15 ( 39·0%; 7662/19 641; p < 0·0001). A cumulative pattern of risk factors <span class="passive">was associated</span> with higher carriage ( figure 5), with adolescents who reported smoking, kissing, and visiting pubs or nightclubs more frequently having up to a five times higher risk of carriage than adolescents who did not participate in those activities. Similar to the odds ratios for carriage by age ( figure 2B), the behavioural risk factors did not change; rather the prevalence of these behaviours changed ( figure 5).Figure 5Risk factors for carriage among UK adolescents in UKMenCar1–4Show full caption ( A) Meningococcal carriage rates by frequency of risk factors in UKMenCar1, the adolescent UK carriage survey done in 1999 ( n=13 919).

UKMenCar1–4 enabled the investigation of meningococcal epidemiology in the UK, providing national, cross-sectional estimates of carriage prevalence in adolescents, enabling the observation of changes over time of genotype replacement, and to facilitate the assessment of the effects of meningococcal vaccine programmes. UKMenCar4 additionally provided definitive molecular characterisation of meningococci carried by UK adolescents in 2014–15. From 1999 to 2015, the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK declined, from 1856 laboratory-confirmed cases in England in 2001–02 to 724 in 2014–15, a 61% reduction.21Public Health EnglandInvasive meningococcal disease ( laboratory reports in England): 2014/2015 annual data by epidemiological year.https: //assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment data/file/498057/hpr3815 imd-crrctd.pdfDate: Oct 23, 2015Date accessed: March 1, 2019Google Scholar Older adolescents generally have the highest rates of meningococcal carriage among countries with similar epidemiology to western Europe.2Christensen H <span class="weasel">May</span> M Bowen L Hickman M Trotter CL Meningococcal carriage by age: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Lancet Infect Dis. 2010; 10: 853-861Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus ( 378) Google Scholar The UKMenCar4 survey identified a 61% reduction in measured carriage prevalence among UK adolescents since 2001, providing a potential explanation for the decrease in invasive meningococcal disease, because of the disruption of meningococcal transmission.22Trotter CL Maiden MC Meningococcal vaccines and herd immunity: lessons learned from serogroup C conjugate vaccination programs.Expert Rev Vaccines. 2009; 8: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus ( 155) Google Scholar These data are consistent with the long-term effectiveness of the MCC national immunisation programme.

From retrospective WGS of 498 UKMenCar1 isolates, there were 13 ( 3%) isolates with MLST discrepancies between PCR-based sequencing and WGS ( data not shown). In all four surveys, regional variability <span class="passive">was observed</span> among sampling centres ( appendix pp 3–4), but these surveys included broadly equivalent populations ( appendix pp 6, 8) and consistent study design. Although 2085 ( 9·6%) of 21 726 swabs <span class="weasel">could</span> not be cultured and <span class="passive">were excluded</span> for technical reasons, overall recruitment excluding these swabs ( 19 641 participants) exceeded the sample size of 18 000 on which the study <span class="passive">was powered</span>.

N lactamica, a closely related oropharyngeal commensal organism, has a different demographic pattern of carriage and potential risk factors to N meningitidis. It was notable that N lactamica carriage prevalence was similar between UKMenCar1 and UKMenCar4; as a result, the ratio of N meningitidis to N lactamica changed from 17:1 ( in 1999) to 6:1 ( in 2014–15). Findings of UKMenCar1–4, which were done in periods of high and low disease incidence in the UK, are consistent with an association between lower incidence of invasive meningococcal disease and lower prevalence of circulating meningococci in adolescents, which in turn <span class="passive">is associated</span> with changing social behaviours.

They wanted to get away from other people and stay safe, and we were all limited in what we <span class="weasel">could</span> do, '' Jagodnik said. `` It pushed people outside and to travel away from others and take the road less traveled, and so the industry just continued to grow. '' Based in Portland, Oregon, Outside Vans provides customers with customized Mercedes-Benz Sprinters made for full-time living. Since the start of the lockdown, Outside Vans has a growing backlog of orders and a growing waitlist. Customers can expect to wait at least eight to 12 months before the company can even start on their projects. Supply chain woes It's one thing to decide to hit the road. It's another to find the right wheels for the trip. The auto industry has been hit especially hard by the one-two punch of a shortage of vital computer chips that's hampered production. <span class="weasel">Some</span> clients couldn't get a van in time to meet the date their builds <span class="passive">were scheduled</span> to start, said Alexa Owens, co-founder of Cascade Custom Vans in Bend, Oregon. `` That was kind of nerve-wracking. '' Cascade Custom Vans, located in Bend, Oregon, has struggled with shortages of materials it needs for its van conversions. Another culprit in the struggle to secure vans: Amazon. As sales surged during pandemic lockdowns, the online retailer kept expanding its fleet to keep up with deliveries. And unfortunately, Amazon's preferred models — Mercedes Sprinters, Ford Transits or RAM ProMasters — are the most popular choices for vanlifers. Even when customers secured a van, delays at ports combined with a labor shortage have slowed the delivery of raw materials needed for the conversions. For Cascade Vans, one of the worst shortages has been windows, which are three months to eight months backordered, Owens said. Cascade, which is fully booked through the year, anticipates at least another year of supply shortages while vendors play catch-up. # Vanlife is hardly cheap A typical van conversion starts starts by gutting a utility van before replacing the interior with the makings of a mobile home: loft beds, mini sinks, toilets, refrigerators and built-in seating. It's not a cheap endeavor. `` With costs of goods going up, our prices have to reflect that, '' lamented Bryan Walker, co-owner of Cascade. `` It's one of those unfortunate things but I think a lot of people are understanding of it right now. '' Bryan Walker and Alexa Owens founded Cascade Custom Vans right before the pandemic. They own their own van still and use their free time to travel. Prices for just the conversion at Cascade can range between $ 50,000 to $ 100,000. At Outside Van, where the company purchases the vans for its customers, prices can reach up to $ 300,000, depending on the customizations a customer chooses. Not included in those figures: the price of gas, which is currently at a seven-year high , and any mechanical issues that come up along the way. An increasingly crowded scene While growing interest in van life, and camping generally, has been great for business, it also has raised questions about the movement's sustainability and effect on the environment. The surge in demand has been `` bittersweet, '' says Walker, who owns a van with Owens. `` Five, six, seven years ago, <span class="weasel">some</span> of the places we 'd go, you 'd be up there alone. Now, there's no trespassing signs, and they 've banned camping in a lot of places because it's just gotten so trashed, '' Walker said. `` You see the places that you love and get to experience doing that lifestyle, and now you're seeing it become kind of exploited. '' Kim and Jesse Butler moved into their van, `` The Walter Mitty, '' right before the pandemic started. During the pandemic, the number of people at National Parks and campsites shot through the roof resulting in an increase of litter, graffiti and the spread of Covid-19, according to reporting from Time . Although the parks have tried to implement restrictions, tourists managed to continue visiting and ignoring restrictions. Kim and Jesse Butler of Port Angeles, Washington moved into their Ram PROMaster, named `` The Walter Mitty, '' right before the pandemic started. They have since traveled traveled up and down the West Coast, pandemic restrictions permitting. The Butlers say they are `` totally self contained, '' and don't leave sewage or trash behind. `` We always do our best to leave no trace and to make sure that we are clean with what we do, '' Jesse told CNN Business.</td>

          <td class="txt"> A key accountant to Donald Trump appeared before a Manhattan grand jury investigating the former President's business practices earlier this year, two people familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. The Washington Post reported earlier Tuesday that the accountant, Donald Bender from the accounting firm Mazers USA, had testified again more recently in a brief appearance before the panel, according to two people familiar with the investigation, but <span class="weasel">could</span> return for additional testimony moving forward. Bender helped prepare the financial statements that the Trump Organization presented to lenders, as well as handled large amounts of Trump's financial information. Prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office also recently met with current and former employees of Deutsche Bank, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Those employees <span class="passive">were asked</span> about representations Trump organization officials made to the bank, which has loaned the company hundreds of millions of dollars over the years. One of those former employees, according to the Post, was Rosemary Vrablic, Trump's top financial adviser at the German lender. Prosecutors asked Vrablic in their interview, which wasn't before a grand jury, about Trump's part in dealings with the bank, one person told the paper. Vrablic's attorney didn't respond to CNN's requests for comment. Read More Trump suffers big court loss in his bid to keep his tax records secret Bender's and Vrablic's reported appearances suggest prosecutors have placed a focus on outside financial advisers to Trump as they work to glean information about his business dealings. Investigators are probing whether the Trump Organization provided inaccurate financial statements about the value of properties when seeking financing and tax assessments, CNN has reported. A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment to CNN. A representative for the Trump Organization <span class="weasel">could</span> not be reached for comment, but the organization has previously called the investigation a politically motivated witch hunt. Mazars told CNN in a statement that `` due to our industry's professional obligations Mazars can not discuss any clients—current or former, the status of our relationships, or the nature of our services in a public forum without client consent or as required by law. We remain committed to fulfilling all of our professional and legal obligations. '' Vance's investigation, which began in earnest in August 2019, includes allegations made by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen that the Trump Organization inflated assets when seeking loans and deflated them when it came time to pay taxes. CNN previously reported that investigators have interviewed Cohen at least eight times and that investigators are looking into numerous loans the Trump Organization has taken out, including those from Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital. Prosecutors are also combing through millions of pages of documents, including Trump's tax returns, which they obtained in February after the US Supreme Court blocked Trump's attempt to stop a subpoena to his longtime accounting firm. The investigation encompasses Trump Tower, the family estate known as Seven Springs, its Chicago hotel and condo tower. Trump Organization formally notifies GSA of proposed sale of DC hotel Prosecutors shifted the investigation to off-the-books compensation this spring and Bender appeared before the grand jury <span class="weasel">around</span> that time, the people said. Prosecutors announced an indictment against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, on tax fraud charges relating to off-the-books compensation in July. The company and Weisselberg have pleaded not guilty. The investigation's focus has shifted back toward the accuracy of the financial statements and representations over the past few months, sources said. Trump has previously said in depositions in civil investigations that Weisselberg helped prepare the financial statements. At the same time, the documents and depositions appear to show that even as Trump claimed that he left those valuation decisions to someone else, he was also deeply involved in running his business. Cohen first made his allegations public in testimony before Congress. At the time he made <span class="weasel">several</span> financial statements public, including one from 2012. In that statement, which CNN has reviewed, Trump's accounting firm notes that `` Donald J Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement, '' adding they did not audit the statement and identified <span class="weasel">several</span> deviations from generally accepted accounting principles. The statement also notes that users `` <span class="weasel">should</span> recognize that they <span class="weasel">might</span> reach different conclusions about the financial condition of Donald J Trump if they had access to a revised statement of financial condition '' without the departures to accounting rules. Lenders like Deutsche Bank <span class="passive">are sophisticated</span> and often perform their own analyses.</td>

Canadian actor Marcus Rosner chatted about his new romantic film “ The Love Club: Nicole’ s Pen Pal. ” By Published Canadian actor Marcus Rosner chatted about his new romantic film “ The Love Club: Nicole’ s Pen Pal, ” which premieres tonight on the Hallmark Channel. In this new original Hallmark movie, Rosner stars opposite Brittany Bristow. The synopsis is: Freshly engaged Nicole ( Brittany Bristow) is having second thoughts as she wonders if the one she’ s really meant to be with is her mystery college pen pal whose letters she has kept all these years. “ It was really great, ” he admitted. “ It’ s a fun girl-gang series of movies and to have the opportunity to pop in and lead one alongside Brittany Bristow was such a treat. ” Rosner had great words about working with Canadian actress Brittany Bristow as his female lead. “ I’ ve wanted to work with her for a while and the experience definitely lived up to the expectation. She is just a wonderfully smart and kind person and brings the exact kind of energy that you need from someone at the top of the call sheet. I’ m looking forward to finding another opportunity for us to team up, ” he said. He was drawn to his character, Josh, for <span class="weasel">several</span> reasons. “ I liked that he wasn’ t always super honest, ” he said. “ Josh had <span class="weasel">some</span> secrets and he did <span class="weasel">some</span> lying but it all came from a deep insecurity he was hiding. Sometimes the male leads in these films are so infallible that it can be kind of an unstimulating experience to play but this guy — even though he had a put-together exterior — was hiding <span class="weasel">some</span> inadequacies. ” On his future plans, Rosner shared, “ Well, I’ m about to appear in Hallmark’ s new original series called ‘ Ride,’ which is premiering at the end of March. It’ s about a famous family of bull-riders who are trying to keep their ranch from going under. Loved that experience. ” “ Learning all about bull riding and being out on a ranch in my home province of Alberta really felt like getting back to my roots. On top of that our own production company Northern Gateway Films, also headquartered in Alberta, is producing six to eight TV Films this year and I’ ll be starring in at least half of those so…busy times, ” he elaborated. Rosner concluded about “ The Love Club: Nicole’ s Pen Pal, ” “ I just want people to enjoy a group of women supporting each other’ s lives professionally, personally, and in the search for love. ” “ I love films about groups of friends. Seeing each individual personality and how they contribute to the chemistry of the group always makes for good storytelling, ” he concluded.

          <td class="txt">Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov has said that although Azerbaijan has large oil and gas resources and is an exporter, one of the main goals is to develop the renewable energy sources field and become a green energy exporter. He made the remarks during a roundtable on the topic “ Azerbaijan-oil, gas and beyond: Prospects for a future energy partnership ” held within the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue conference. “ Given the large solar and wind energy projects currently <span class="passive">being implemented</span>, the rich potential of renewable energy sources on land - about 27,000 megawatts, and offshore - 157,000 megawatts, as well as plans to build two new lines that will ensure an increase in electricity exports to Europe, it can be said that Azerbaijan has great prospects to become a source of the green energy corridor, ” he said. The minister underlined that this also makes Azerbaijan’ s next contribution to the diversification of Europe’ s energy supply through green energy. He stressed that companies from Germany can become important partners in bilateral long-term energy cooperation in this direction. Stressing that Germany's trade with Azerbaijan increased by 57 percent last year, the minister spoke about the prospects for developing cooperation between the two countries in new areas. Shahbazov noted that the end of the long-term conflict fully ensured security, which is one of the main prerequisites for the inflow of investments into the region. In this regard, he stressed that the widespread use of renewable energy sources both in the liberated Karabakh and East Zangazur economic zones and in the country as a whole has <span class="passive">been identified</span> as one of the country’ s national priorities. “ All this, along with the potential and goals of Azerbaijan related to green energy, the rich experience of German companies, as well as the combination of possible investment opportunities, can open a new page in energy cooperation, ” he said. The participants of the event also discussed the effective cooperation relations with VPC, Siemens, Berlin Wind and other German companies in the field of energy. They noted that fruitful cooperation <span class="passive">was established</span> with the German Energy Agency-DENA to prepare four pilot project proposals to <span class="weasel">support</span> the development of decentralized renewable energy in Azerbaijan. To expand cooperation, German companies have <span class="passive">been invited</span> to participate in renewable energy projects.</td>

          <td class="txt">Hi, what are you looking for? By Published Brazil’ s central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 13.75% on Wednesday, remarking that inflation “ remains high ” despite receding for three months in a row, just four days before a presidential election. It is the second meeting in a row that the bank’ s monetary policy committee left the Selic interest rate unchanged after putting the brakes on 12 straight increases. In a statement, the monetary committee said it remained “ vigilant ” and that the high interest rate level would be maintained “ as long as it takes to control inflation. ” The committee did not rule out a “ resumption of the cycle of increases ” if prices do not lower “ as expected. ” For now, “ inflation remains high ” despite dropping for <span class="weasel">several</span> months. The decision comes as the country braces for a divisive second-round presidential election between far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and leftist former leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday. The interest rate decision was in line with market forecasts, which <span class="passive">were reflected</span> in a survey of more than a hundred consultants and financial institutions by the Valor economic newspaper. The benchmark interest rate has remained at the same level since August, when the committee applied the last increase of half a percentage point. Haunted by a history of hyperinflation, Brazil was among the first countries to start raising interest rates after the monetary easing of the coronavirus pandemic when the Selic stood at a record low of two percent. Since March 2021, the central bank had rapidly raised its key rate from an all-time low of two percent, including three whopping hikes of 1.5 percentage points from October 2021 to February 2022. The long period of high inflation in Latin America’ s largest economy has <span class="passive">been fueled</span> by rising global food and oil prices spurred on by the war between Russia and Ukraine. – Slowing inflation – This trend has slowed in recent months. The consumer price index was negative in July ( -0.68 percent), August ( -0.36 percent) and September ( -0.29 percent). Annual inflation stood at 7.17 percent in September, prior to the first round of the presidential elections on October 2. The successive declines reduced market forecasts, and inflation is now expected to lower to 5.60 percent by the end of the year, almost half of what was initially projected, according to a survey released by the central bank ( BCB) this week. Bolsonaro has highlighted the “ unprecedented deflation ” during his campaign. He is currently polling 45 percent to Lula’ s 49 percent ahead of the second round, according to Datafolha polling data published Friday. Economists warn, however, that the negative trend is not yet established and that price increases are still a latent threat. By keeping the Selic at the current high level, the monetary committee hopes that 2023 inflation will lower to the 3.25 percent target set by the central bank. Only then can they begin cutting rates, analysts say. Analysts have warned about the impact of high interest rates on GDP, which <span class="passive">is projected</span> to grow 2.76 percent by the end of this year, far from the stagnation that <span class="passive">was expected</span> in early 2022, according to the BCB Focus survey. Brazil is easing up on its interest rate as the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have shifted into full-on tightening to curb inflation.

Create Account  Since last year, the continent’ s biggest economy has rapidly adopted LNG amid fears of gas shortages caused by Russia’ s supply cuts. Now it wants to expand capacity for handling the super-chilled fuel so that it can boost exports to nations — mostly in eastern Europe — in the coming years.

Please try again  Germany has already fast-tracked <span class="weasel">several</span> LNG projects — including terminals in Wilhelmshaven and Lubmin — and plans to open more floating and land-based facilities in the months and years ahead. The government sees a need to boost capacities to ensure energy security, though critics say that massive overcapacity for transporting the fossil fuel endangers climate goals.  Berlin expects to ship about 5.5 billion cubic meters of fuel to European nations this year, rising to 6.7 billion in 2026, according to an Economy Ministry report for the budget committee. It sees demand for deliveries from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Ukraine and Moldova.  With current infrastructure not sufficient to meet demand home and abroad, the expansion is in line with what’ s needed “ and necessary in terms of European solidarity, ” according to the report.  By 2024, six floating storage and regasification units <span class="weasel">could</span> allow capacity to handle at least 37 billion cubic meters per year, the report showed. The figure <span class="weasel">could</span> reach 54 billion cubic meters once permanent land terminals in Brunsbuettel, Stade and Wilhelmshaven open by 2026-27.  That’ s close to Spain’ s current LNG import capacity, according to European Union data. While LNG terminals aren’ t always fully used, it would help Europe live without Russian pipeline gas, a study by the Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne for the government showed.  Gas trade between European countries increased last year, when those with diversified supply sources — such as LNG — sent more fuel to neighbors by pipeline, especially in eastern Europe.  The UK boosted fuel shipments to the continent to a record last summer and continued deliveries even during the heating season. Britain normally would import gas from mainland Europe in colder months as it lacks storage to cover peak heating demand. But a mild winter and strong LNG imports kept UK gas prices mostly below those in the EU, encouraging exports.  Climate groups criticized Germany’ s LNG expansion plan.  “ The federal government is planning with unnecessary overcapacities and is negligent in dealing with the climate targets, ” said Constantin Zerger at Environmental Action Germany.  —With assistance from Elena Mazneva.

First, we chose six public-private engagements from the literature involving local private sector actors that were well-documented and evaluated. Then, we analyzed the articles ( and, where possible, new interviews that we conducted with implementers and researchers) using a validated factors codebook. Finally, we carried out a thematic analysis to understand trends in helping/hindering factors and outcomes. Though our six case studies come from <span class="weasel">around</span> the world — Bangladesh, Brazil, Guatemala, India and Malawi — we began to notice an interesting trend emerging across the cases. We realized that, across the board, factors were much more closely linked than expected: instead of existing independently, factors intersected and impacted each other. Factors can play a big role in helping or hindering an engagement, and so it’ s worth understanding the complex interplay and relationships between the factors that practitioners <span class="weasel">could</span> leverage in strengthening engagements. Understanding how factors <span class="passive">are linked</span>, how they impact each other, and causal relationships ( when possible) is important for strengthening both new and existing public-private engagements. Intrigued by these emerging links, we wanted to know more — were there trends in these linkages? Were <span class="weasel">some</span> factors more closely associated than others? Were there any temporal trends in linkages that <span class="weasel">could</span> indicate the potential for causality? We carried out a system mapping to visualize how the factors <span class="passive">were connected</span> ( Figure 1). Figure 1 above depicts the map of connected factors in our six secondary case studies. A line between two factors indicates that the linkage appeared at least once within a case. Therefore, the highest possible number of linkages between any two factors on this map is six ( which would indicate that the linkage showed up in every case). <span class="weasel">Some</span> factors in the map are clearly more linked than others. This <span class="weasel">may</span> indicate that the highly linked factors are more important than those with fewer linkages, though we certainly can’ t make any conclusions — we’ ll call it a hypothesis worth studying more. Structural factors showed up in all six case studies and is the only factor ( out of nine total) that has linkages to all of the others. Structural factors provide the architecture for a PPE, encapsulating its engagement model, resources and formality of arrangement. Structural factors, by definition, act as the framework upon which an engagement is built. There can’ t even be an engagement without structural factors to shape it — it’ s no wonder this factor is so heavily connected to all the others. These linkages showed up in our cases in many concrete ways. In a public-private engagement in Bangladesh, the comprehensive contract structuring the service provision engagement between public and private sectors connected to the strong mutual understanding between partners on their respective roles/responsibilities. In an example from India, on the other hand, private providers involved in the scheme reported delays in reimbursements for services from the government ( structural), which <span class="passive">was linked</span> to the lack of trust between the two parties in the engagement. We also noticed a strong three-way correlation between structural, accountability, and technical and managerial capacities. This isn’ t evident in the factor map above but, in our analysis, we noticed that these three almost always appear together. That’ s to say, in a linkage between structural and accountability, technical and managerial capacities are <span class="weasel">likely</span> implicated too. This <span class="weasel">could</span> be because accountability mechanisms are usually included in the structure of an engagement and hinge on partner capacities to successfully implement them. For example, in a case in Guatemala, the government increased their capacity to implement effective accountability mechanisms over the course of the engagement, which were laid out in the engagement’ s structure. In Malawi, a lack of accountability mechanisms laid out in the engagement’ s structure at the beginning of the engagement, combined with a lack of supervision ( capacities) to monitor accountability informally, <span class="passive">were cited</span> as contributing factors to a lack of trust between parties. We get it — <span class="weasel">some</span> of these factor linkages <span class="weasel">may</span> seem intuitive ( or, on the other end of the spectrum, overly academic) — so why did we take the time to create a factor map? We know from our earlier work that factors are incredibly important to PPE success. The logical next question is “ So how do we strengthen factors to ensure optimal public-private engagement performance? ” This is where factor linkages come in. <span class="weasel">Some</span> factors, like trust, are difficult to directly impact. Trust must be built over time; especially if there is a history of challenging relationships, parties are unlikely to immediately trust each other, and it can be difficult to implement trust-building interventions. What we <span class="weasel">could</span> do, however, is focus on improving a factor that we know <span class="passive">is linked</span> to trust. For example, Figure 1 shows that trust <span class="passive">is linked</span> to accountability, communication, and mutual understanding — all factors that <span class="weasel">could</span> be directly targeted. If we work to improve communication between parties, say through the implementation of quarterly partner progress meetings, we <span class="weasel">may</span> be able to improve the quality of communication through positive interactions and begin to build trust. Similarly, a public-private engagement lacking trust <span class="weasel">might</span> benefit from a roles clarification exercise to improve mutual understanding, or systematic monthly monitoring visits to improve accountability. Of course, in introducing this type of accountability into the system, it’ s important to make sure that new initiatives don’ t exacerbate existing power imbalances and that the goal is supportive supervision rather than over-regulation…which <span class="weasel">could</span> have downstream negative impacts on the trust, instead of strengthening it. It’ s also important to understand linkages between factors because <span class="weasel">some</span> factors are more difficult to change than others. For example, environmental factors — including the political, legal and regulatory environment — often take time and effort to change. It’ s important to understand the impact of factors on others and compensate for them if necessary. Environmental factors <span class="passive">are linked</span> to will to engage and engagement rationale. If a public-private engagement’ s environment <span class="weasel">could</span> weaken any connected factors, we can provide additional <span class="weasel">support</span> to those vulnerable factors in an attempt to insulate them from damage. Overall, we <span class="weasel">believe</span> that understanding the relationships between factors can help improve understanding of public-private engagement and provide levers for strengthening it. The Strengthening Mixed Health Systems project <span class="passive">is supported</span> by funding from Merck, through Merck for Mothers, the company’ s global initiative to help create a world where no woman has to die while giving life. Merck for Mothers is known as MSD for Mothers outside the United States and Canada. Your email address will not be published. Required fields <span class="passive">are marked</span> *</td>

          <td class="txt">In the span of ten years blockchain has grown from a doubted cryptocurrency-focused technology into a secure, widely used method of business process automation. A decentralized ledger allows to perform operations and maintain system privacy at a lower cost due to all data distributed and stored on working stations within the blockchain unlike traditional SAP-based solutions where data <span class="passive">is stored</span> outside the system. Through immutability and traceability, a blockchain-based platform in retail would serve as a highly trusted, one-for-all solution for suppliers, manufacturers and other chain participants. Blockchain in the retail market The market of blockchain in retail <span class="passive">is expected</span> to grow up to a remarkable 1937 million USD at a compound annual growth rate of 60% during 2020-2025. The sum seems even more persuasive compared to the volume of the blockchain in the retail market in 2019 when it comprised 113 million USD. The outstanding growth <span class="passive">is explained</span> by the rising need for truly traceable, scalable customer service which became crucially important for the global retail massively affected by the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. At the same time, <span class="weasel">some</span> of the market experts forecast the retail market volume to grow to 2339.5 million USD by 2023 due to the technology’ s high adoption in the banking and compliance industries that are tightly tied to retail. Fast transactions, immutable service and verifiable delivery tracking without human control have become must-haves for mobile and online e-commerce in the time of home sitting. Out of all available technologies blockchain grants more advantages in the long run such as cut costs and transparent retail supply chain management. At present, blockchain in retail is mainly applied in compliance management, document handling through smart contracts, supply chain and inventory management, transactions, customer care automation, and identification. Asia becomes a key player in the modern retail market with its rising number of ecommerce startups. Online retail platforms like China’ s Alibaba start opening stores in shopping malls of Australia moving retailers from online to offline. Despite the risk of closure faced by the majority of retailers in 2020 due to the pandemic, the smooth lockdown waiver continues showcasing that real-life retail is still highly demanded. Ecommerce <span class="weasel">should</span> go through certain changes so as to provide maximum benefits of both online and offline shopping at a maximally secure level. A retailer’ s success strongly depends on its supply chain, a pivotal part of retail. A blockchain development company, blockchain enables retailers to boost customer loyalty, improve logistical efficiency and skyrocket consumer privacy. Smart contracts Smart contracts continue winning the market of transaction management and compliance. Unlike manual verification, smart contracts eliminate the risk of failure due to human error since compliance checkup <span class="passive">is performed</span> automatically by the system code in accordance with the embedded regulations. Once transaction requirements are met, a transaction <span class="passive">is performed</span> with smart contracts meaning that it can not be compromised, lost or changed without prior consent of authorized retail supply chain participants. In recent years, smart contracts have been widely used in corporate operations such as supply chain management, billing, transaction processing, and inventory management. Blockchain-based process automation brings cost reduction as it helps to remove intermediary agents and to cut down headcount required for operational and auditing tasks. Fraud is a common pain point in retail. According to “ LexisNexis True Cost of Fraud ” report, a large merchant loses 1 USD from every 13.20 USD on average due to fraudulent activity in the supply chain. Fraud can take place in situations with lack of supervision during transportation, warehousing or sales control. Automated IoT-powered control systems <span class="weasel">may</span> be used in retail to <span class="weasel">advance</span> shipping control, inventory management and customer service, securing the most sensitive parts with smart contracts. Retail’ s savior The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of the US as of 2011 required the food industry to implement health protection measures including food origin tracking. Blockchain turned out to be a perfect instrument for it due to its almost instant transactions, eliminated risk of fraud, transparency, and proven information security. According to the Section 103 of the CPSIA amended section 14 ( c) of the Consumer Product Safety Act ( “ CPSA ”) ( 15 U.S.C. 2063 ( c)), traceable labels must be used on every product applicable. This is to immediately block use of prohibited materials and components in products. Along with that, Congress released the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act to make children’ s products traceable, too, aiming to remove counterfeit products containing unregistered, dangerous components or ingredients. Data authenticity is by all means one of the major factors that retail <span class="weasel">should</span> sustain, and hence, data security is a prime focus here. Use of a single database storage or a third-party server often implies the risk of data loss or compromising as it conveys consumer banking and personal information. And here blockchain brings to the table its distributed ledger technology when all information <span class="passive">is shared</span> within the retailer’ s authorized working stations. In blockchain, data can be programmed to be automatically verified for compliance; each important operation requires approval by all authorized participants. As a result, data can not be changed or compromised, each action can be traced back to the origin, and information can not be lost since it <span class="passive">is duplicated</span> on multiple machines. Major players in the blockchain for retail’ s market are SAP SE, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon. In 2019, IBM and Scentre Group, an Australia-based shopping center operator, teamed with local financial companies to develop a private blockchain under the retail lease bank guarantee. Same year, months after joining IBM’ s Food Trust blockchain Nestle and a blockchain-based platform OpenSC started developing a blockchain to distinguish Nestle from Food Trust. This fact especially highlights Nestle's confidence in the potential of blockchain for retail. And the same year, a Russian retail giant Dixy moved its corporate financial system to blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that can solve the above-mentioned issues. One of the core benefits of blockchain is the capability to trace item origin back to the moment of its entry into the system database. Products, documents and other items get individual tags which can be used for distinguished end-to-end transparency in the supply chain. Using a blockchain-based system, manufacturers can manage orders, shipping documents or other supplementary requirements. Suppliers can track shipments and logistics, manage invoicing and provide product origin tracking opportunities for supply chain participants and consumers. Communication within the supply chain gets simplified thanks to automated processes so that participants only have to follow up in case of irregular breaches. Similarly, defective items can be tagged and processed separately visibly to all chain authorized chain participants for immediate reaction. With blockchain, retailers leverage its remarkable features boosting the revenue through the combination of cut administrative expenses and improved supply chain management, and bring customer service to a new level by ensuring product originality and service optimization. 13152</td>

          <td class="txt">CHICAGO, IL — June 24, 2022 — With over 1,250 participants, the fifth edition of the PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION successfully closed in Düsseldorf, Germany. The event was again an important platform for multichannel and dialog marketing. The focus was on sustainable media production, programmatic print and value-added printing. The unique concept of congress and trade show ensured a communicative and busy atmosphere and enabled long-awaited networking and knowledge transfer at the booths and the presentations. The annual industry event has not only firmly established itself in the German-speaking region – many visitors also came from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. “ The atmosphere was excellent! Compared to the previous event, we were able to record an increase of over 50% in the number of participants. That’ s a top result ”, said Rüdiger Maaß, Managing Director of Fachverband Medienproduktion ( f: mp.). “ And we managed to bring the right target groups together to network and exchange ideas intensively. It was a wonderfully inspiring two days – not only for us, but also for the entire industry! ” Nine theme worlds, four stages, 50 top-class speakers, 19 half-hour presentations each day and 63 international exhibitors – including DATEV, Deutsche Post, FKS, Kodak, Konica Minolta, Mondi, Xerox and HP – offered participants future-oriented content on the potential of digital printing applications, multichannel solutions, creative finishing and sustainable packaging solutions. Visitors were particularly interested in the seven highlight projects which f: mp. realized with its partners. These projects represent hands-on best practice and thus reflect the special unique selling point of the PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION: a “ hands-on ” trade show with concrete and practical application examples. In order to get new and young target groups interested in print and packaging, the Media Production Association and Messe Düsseldorf, as organizers of the congress trade show, cooperated with the Fritz-Henßler-Berufskolleg ( FHBK) from Dortmund, the Stuttgart Media University, the Akademie für Mode & Design ( AMD) Düsseldorf and the Berufskolleg Bachstraße from Düsseldorf. The young talents of tomorrow were able to find out directly from the experts at the booths and in the lectures about the fascinating applications of print and packaging in modern and sustainable media production. “ Even in the digital age, print is highly relevant and indispensable in its many facets – we want to convey this to the younger generation in particular, ” explained Sabine Geldermann, Project Director Print Technologies at Messe Düsseldorf. “ The response from students and trainees was very good. The demand for information is extraordinarily high! Young people want direct access to the market and want to experience live what potential print has to offer. ” For this reason, the organizers are planning to increase investment in the skilled workers of tomorrow even further for the next edition of PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION. For example, it <span class="passive">is planned</span> to offer “ Youngster Talent Recruitment ” for prospective trainees and interested companies while a “ Start-up Area ” will connect established companies with young and innovative newcomers. The sixth edition of the PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION will take place in <span class="weasel">May</span> 2023 in Düsseldorf, Germany ( before drupa 2024).

Frank Siegel, Managing Director Obility GmbH “ The PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION presented itself as the perfect marketplace for the graphic arts industry. Everyone was there: brand owners, buyers, production people, printing companies and suppliers. This advantage paid off for us in concrete terms. We were able to demonstrate how print stores can process jobs much faster and more cost-effectively with our modern ERP/MIS system and make their work easier for their customers with integrated customer stores, web-to-print and job interfaces. These advantages of digitized business processes <span class="passive">were reported</span> to us by visitors. So we are now looking forward to follow-up appointments and certainly interesting projects. ” +++ Christian Kulhanek, Key Account Manager Digital & Print Solutions DATEV eG “ You can literally feel that there is more dynamism and movement in the industry again. The desire to network and exchange ideas has increased. This shows that the digital solution is not the only one – it’ s the mix that counts! I see myself as a digital print bridge builder. The audience at the PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION was broad and thus perfectly matched DATEV’ s equally broad range of products and services. It was a matter close to our heart to present our trainee project “ DATEV Cookbook ” at the fair – presented by the trainees themselves. The special thing about it: The entire process of creating the cookbook <span class="passive">was implemented</span> independently by our junior staff from A to Z. ” Sebastian Hardung, Director Alliances & Marketing print Group / Werk II Medien- und Informationsgesellschaft mbH “ As a long-standing exhibitor at the PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION and a strategic partner of f: mp., we <span class="passive">are delighted</span> to be present again this year. For us, the trade show is a place of encounters and it is here that you notice that the industry wants to meet and exchange ideas again. We are noticing more and more in the market that print as a medium is no longer <span class="passive">being declared</span> dead but has arrived in the mainstream of digital marketing. As a software manufacturer, we are all the more pleased to accompany the further development of partners and customers. That’ s why we also joined the Programmatic Print Alliances ( PPA) in January. ” +++ Kim Niemeyer, Marketing & Communication, Ing. Fritz Schroeder GmbH & Co. KG, Barsbüttel “ The industry get-together shows once again that print is alive and how print can be experienced. We <span class="passive">are delighted</span> to be part of the PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION and to help shape the mix of technology, knowledge transfer and networking. For FKS, this year’ s event was all about Industry 4.0, because automation and networking are the be-all and end-all of efficient process design these days. We were also able to present a European premiere for our B2 solution in the area of multifinishing. We held exciting discussions on all aspects of printing, postpress and intelligent process design and thus jointly developed and took away valuable inspiration and innovative ideas. ” +++ Bernhard Cantzler, Head of Marketing & Innovation at Mondi Uncoated Fine Paper “ At this year’ s PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION, we were able to hold exciting personal discussions with representatives from industry, retail and brand manufacturers. We also received positive feedback from numerous visitors about the interesting presentations. Here, for example, we were able to connect very well with the sustainability presentations with the fact that all Mondi own brands such as PERGRAPHICA® or Color Copy are Cradle to Cradle Certified® Bronze. A huge compliment to the excellent organization, which allows us to focus on our core competence: Advising customers on paper selection. ” +++ Mirko Pelzer, Offering Manager Professional Printing Konica Minolta “ The PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION is a driver of innovation. <span class="weasel">Various</span> companies and industries show here how the graphic arts industry will produce tomorrow. And all this in a familiar atmosphere with many and good opportunities for networking. That’ s why Konica Minolta has been part of the event since the very first edition. We also have a traditional and longstanding partnership with f: mp. The PRINT & DIGITAL CONVENTION is something special: The focus is not on the pure sale of machines, but rather on demonstrating solutions and application possibilities. To this end, Konica Minolta has implemented GLAMPRINT – a symbiosis of glamour and print. Here we can show all printing options and solutions that are possible in extended four-color printing. The focus for us is to offer the customer added value. This year, we were particularly pleased that many young students and trainees visited the trade show. ”</td>

          <td class="txt">December 1, 2021 TEPCO Renewable Power, Inc. The pioneering floating wind project, TetraSpar Demonstrator, <span class="passive">is commissioned</span> and in operation, anchored in place at 200 m water depth off Norway's coast. The project will now enter its test phase where data on the performance and characteristics of the TetraSpar floating foundation will be cap-tured and analyzed to pave the way for commercial-scale floating wind projects. Earlier this summer, the TetraSpar Demonstrator reached its destination at the METCentre test site after a tow of 360 nautical miles from the port of assembly in Grenaa, Denmark. The commissioning of the 3.6 MW Siemens turbine is the last in a string of milestones for the TetraSpar Demonstrator: The demonstration project has shown that Stiesdal's 'Tetra ' concept remains on target to offer im-portant advantages over existing floating wind concepts, with the potential for leaner manufacturing, assembly, and installation processes, and with lower material costs. Henrik Stiesdal, Chairman of the board of directors of TetraSpar Demonstrator ApS, said: `` This is a huge milestone for the project. First and foremost, we are happy to have completed all phases of the project without any <span class="weasel">significant</span> safety incidents, even though we have deployed a very innovative project with a range of world's first elements. The deep experience of our project part-ners has been invaluable in this regard. Next, we are obviously very pleased that the new technolo-gies, a few years ago only ambitions and design proposals, have now come to fruition. All indica-tions are that our key target, to accelerate the industrialization of floating offshore wind, can actually be met, not only at prototype level but at large scale. '' Thomas Brostrom, Senior Vice President Renewables at Shell said: `` We are extremely proud to have reached this important milestone and to have contributed to the realization of a truly innovative floating concept. Shell <span class="passive">is committed</span> to further develop the floating wind industry globally by providing technical and financial <span class="weasel">support</span> to promising concepts such as Tetraspar. Ultimately, we hope to deploy floating wind technology globally and at large scale to en-able further decarbonization of our customers ' activities and for society as a whole. '' Seiichi Fubasami, President of TEPCO RP, said: `` There are high expectations throughout the world for floating offshore wind farms. One of the most challenging endeavors underway is the TetraSpar floating foundation demonstration project. Each stage in the process, from manufacturing and assembly, to launch and deployment, has done well, and we are very excited now to have the demonstrator in operation, thereby reaching an important milestone towards commercial operation of the TetraSpar. In Japan we expect more floating offshore wind farms to be built from 2030 and onward as we <span class="weasel">aim</span> for realization of carbon neutrality in 2050. The TetraSpar concept can be utilized in Japan's natural conditions and enables the easy construction of regional supply chains thereby playing an important role as we <span class="weasel">aim</span> to transition to renewable energies as baseload power sources. This is a promising new technology for the future and we expect the TetraSpar floater to perform well during operation off the coast of Norway over the next couple of years. '' Sven Utermöhlen, CEO Offshore Wind of RWE Renewables, underlined: `` This project has been both challenging and inspiring. The spark of genius with the TetraSpar con-cept is its industrialized manufacturing and assembly methodology, which we think is crucial for long-term cost reduction. Our deep involvement in this project means we have now gathered first-hand evidence about how this approach can be scaled up to commercial projects. This project has taught us more crucial lessons than we <span class="weasel">could</span> have ever expected, and it has been great to work so collaboratively with our project partners to safely deliver such an innovative tech-nology. It has been particularly interesting to see how important it is to transfer RWE's experience in seabed-fixed offshore wind into our floating projects. This project's success motivates us to keep on delivering cutting edge innovation. '' The upcoming test phase will provide the four partnering companies with important knowledge and opportunities to further refine the TetraSpar technology. The partners will make full use of the re-sults obtained to expand the possibilities of offshore wind power and thereby contribute to the realization of a clean and sustainable carbon-neutral society.
