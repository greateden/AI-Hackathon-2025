On Dec. 20, PrimeStone disclosed it owned 2% of Brenntag's shares and urged the company to drop the talks, which it said smacked of risky empire-building with attendant anti-trust challenges that would lower the companies ' gross profits. The activist investor, which two years ago pushed for cost cuts at British wealth manager St. James's Place, urged the company to buy back shares and prepare to split up into two separate companies. Brenntag combines units that engage in the modestly margined business of transporting chemicals with more specialist and faster-growing units that deal with industries like pharmaceuticals and nutrition.

By Published The new study relates to businesses in the U.K., although the results are of relevance to most advanced industrialized economies. The study <span class="passive">is titled</span> “ Creating a Culture of Digital Transformation. ” The headline statement from the Microsoft study is that <span class="weasel">around</span> half ( 49 percent) of companies polled reported that they fear the effects that accompany digital transformation. This fear creates an inertia that suppresses the business benefits of changing business models along digital lines. The survey results <span class="passive">were unveiled</span> at Microsoft’ s Future Decoded event, which was held in London at the end of October 2017. For the study, Microsoft worked with Goldsmiths College ( part of the University of London) and the polling organization YouGov. The survey scope formed 1,003 Business leaders in middle management or above in UK businesses with 500+ employees. Fear of change The study also discovered that 61 percent of employees admitted a degree of anxiety when a new way of working or a new type of technology <span class="passive">is introduced</span> into the workplace. Part of this appears to be driven by employment concerns, since 59 percent of workers expressed concerns about the impact of automation on their jobs. As a parallel, recent research by the German company Siemens, reported by Digital Journal, found that automation is most <span class="weasel">likely</span> to lead to an increase in employment with robots spearheading job creation rather than job reduction. This is with the caveat that automation happens sooner rather than later. Culture transformation These differing concerns perhaps explain why only 53 percent of U.K. companies have an active digital transformation program in place. Noting that digital transformation is only partly about technology, for changes to workplace culture and working practices also need to occur, the survey also found that just 23 per cent of firms have a program centered on cultural change in place. Following on from this, Cindy Rose, who is Microsoft’ s U.K. Chief Executive, stated: “ Digital transformation is not just a technology deployment or an IT exercise, it’ s a people exercise. Leaders of all organizations must therefore embrace cultural transformation from the top and <span class="weasel">explore</span> the behavioral shifts needed to bring about lasting change. ” The risk stemming from this analysis, IT Portal reports, is that U.K. businesses ( together with those similarly placed worldwide) that do not have digital transformation processes in place are <span class="weasel">likely</span> to become uncompetitive.

The drug is a PD-1 inhibitor or checkpoint inhibitor. The FDA had recently granted full approval to Merck's own blockbuster checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda ( pembrolizumab), for the same indication, and the agency recommended Agenus withdraw the application. Agenus’ s BLA was <span class="passive">being reviewed</span> under an Accelerated Approval pathway as well as Fast Track and Priority Review designations. The target action date was December 16, 2021. Agenus indicates it plans to <span class="weasel">continue</span> its development strategies for balstilimab in combination with other drugs. Merck’ s Keytruda <span class="passive">was granted</span> accelerated approval in second-line cervical cancer in 2018. Then, in mid-October, the FDA granted it first-line approval with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. The trial was not only for first-line advanced cervical cancer but also a confirmatory trial for the accelerated approval, allowing the agency to convert the accelerated approval over to a standard approval. “ While the commercial market for balstilimab monotherapy in second-line cervical cancer was always anticipated to be small, Agenus’ priority remains developing balstilimab as a necessary component of highly effective and affordable combination therapies, both with its own portfolio and with partners, including in combination with Agenus’ next-generation CTLA-4, AGEN1181, ” said Garo Armen, chief executive officer and chairman of Agenus. Agenus plans to discontinue its <span class="weasel">ongoing</span> confirmatory trial. Shares plunged 22% to $ 3.98 in premarket trading today at the news. It is also expected to decrease its research and development expenses by more than $ 100 million due to the shift. Because the drug has demonstrated clinical benefit, the company is considering launching an expanded access program that would allow patients and doctors access to the drug in <span class="weasel">several</span> countries, including the U.S. Although the company statement indicates it is voluntarily withdrawing the BLA, reporting suggests the company is not happy with the decision and that Armen has written to the FDA’ s Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA’ s Oncology Center of Excellence for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, to intervene. “ This seemingly quick approval of pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) hours before Agenus’ s late-cycle meeting suggests that FDA <span class="weasel">may</span> have afforded special consideration to Merck, the sponsor of the pembrolizumab application, ” Armen wrote to Pazdur. “ The fact that pembrolizumab’ s approval blocked Agenus’ s chances of accelerated approval further implies that FDA was not intending to afford balstilimab the full and fair review that it deserves. ” There have been suggestions that the FDA is getting tougher on accelerated approvals. They are usually granted for drugs with a high unmet need but require the companies to run post-marketing studies to determine if the drugs are as effective as they seem to be in earlier trials. Accelerated approvals are typically based on surrogate endpoints, such as biomarker readouts, rather than a specific clinical benefit. <span class="weasel">Several</span> accelerated approvals have <span class="passive">been rescinded</span> this year and <span class="weasel">some</span> unexpected rejections to <span class="weasel">support</span> the argument that the agency is getting tougher on accelerated approvals. On March 1, Merck voluntarily withdrew the U.S. indication for Keytruda for metastatic small cell lung cancer ( SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other previous line of therapy. And before that, AstraZeneca had withdrawn its own checkpoint inhibitor Imfinzi in bladder cancer over a similar response.</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>E ONSE</td><td>marketscreener</td><td>business</td><td>0.277</td><td>0.703</td><td>1</td><td>0.490</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td><div class="txt">Munich Re and syndicates within the Lloyd's of London market are among the major underwriters for Nord Stream 1, four industry sources with knowledge of the situation said, adding that it was unclear whether they would renew its cover. If the insurance is not renewed, the prospect of the pipeline bringing gas to Europe under the Baltic Sea ever <span class="passive">being repaired</span> and restarted becomes more remote. Even before leaks were found, supplies via Nord Stream 1 had <span class="passive">been halted</span> as a result of a dispute over Western sanctions on Russia, while the newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipeline had not started commercial deliveries. While a claim has not yet been made for the damage and disruption to the pipeline, two of the sources told Reuters, Nord Stream 1's underwriters <span class="weasel">may</span> dispute any submitted on the grounds that the damage was an act of self-sabotage, or of war, neither of which are generally covered by insurance. Amid speculation as to who was behind alleged sabotage that severed the pipelines at the centre of an energy crisis prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Danish police said on Oct. 18 that the damage to Nord Stream 1 <span class="passive">was caused</span> by powerful blasts. While damage itself would not necessarily affect the renewal of a property policy, insurers <span class="weasel">might</span> ask for more premium, said Tim Shepherd, a litigation partner at Mayer Brown. For the underwriters of the pipeline system, which Nord Stream's website says was built with 7.8 billion euros ( $ 7.6 billion) of investment, the stakes are high. Reuters was not able to identify all of its underwriters, but another of the sources said Swiss insurer Zurich also had exposure to Nord Stream 1. Munich Re, Zurich and Lloyd's all declined to comment. `` Even if you are taking a small size ( of cover), it is a big risk, '' one of the four industry sources said. `` The issue is going to be what happens if you can't prove it is a state sponsor ( responsible for the blasts), you end up with a massive claim for damage, '' the source added. Nord Stream 1's majority shareholder with a 51% stake is a subsidiary of Russian energy group Gazprom, which is subject to sanctions by the United States, Britain and Canada as well as <span class="weasel">some</span> European Union restrictions. Two of the sources said renewal of Nord Stream 1 cover by the Lloyd's syndicates would be challenging given the risk of tighter sanctions on Gazprom, which would prevent paying claims. German energy groups Wintershall and E.ON, meanwhile, hold 15.5% each. Wintershall did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An E.ON spokesperson said Nord Stream 1's operating company was responsible for operational issues, including insurance. `` Nord Stream AG remains in close contact with relevant authorities about the recent incident. Due to prevailing uncertainties, we as a shareholder continuously monitor developments and are in close contact with the other relevant stakeholders, '' the spokesperson said. Gazprom and Swiss-based Nord Stream AG, did not respond to requests for comment, while French energy provider ENGIE, which has a 9% stake, declined to comment. Dutch natural gas infrastructure company N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie, which also has a 9% stake, said it would assess the situation as soon as there was more clarity. `` The exact extent of the damage and possible follow-up actions can only be determined after inspection of the pipelines and that is not yet possible at this moment, '' Gasunie said. `` We are in close contact with our European partners and the relevant government authorities, '' it added. 'DELIBERATE ACT '? Nord Stream's insurers will have to prove that its policy does not cover the damage caused by the blasts in order to avoid paying out on any claim, lawyers said. Although property policies typically exclude malicious damage, policy holders often buy extra cover, which is <span class="weasel">likely</span> in Nord Stream's case, legal and insurance sources said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the United States and its allies blew up the pipelines, an allegation that has <span class="passive">been dismissed</span> by the White House. U.S. President Joe Biden has said damage to Nord Stream was a deliberate act of sabotage. The West has not directly pointed the finger at Moscow, which has denied any involvement. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this month that Nordic leaders had told their European partners it was still impossible to say at this stage who was behind the damage. If a Western state actor was found to be responsible, the damage <span class="weasel">might</span> be designated as an act of terror, which one broking source said <span class="weasel">might</span> be covered by insurance. However, if investigations found Russia to have <span class="passive">been involved</span>, insurers <span class="weasel">could</span> argue it was an act of `` self-sabotage '', given Gazprom <span class="passive">is owned</span> by the state. `` If there was a deliberate act by the policyholder, you are not going to have a covered claim, '' said David Pryce, managing partner at Fenchurch Law, which is not involved with the policy. If there was any Russian involvement it <span class="weasel">could</span> also mean the Nord Stream 1 damage <span class="passive">being designated</span> as an act of war, something that is typically excluded by insurance policies.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg, Bloomberg ( Bloomberg) -- Companies from Microsoft Corp. to Texas Instruments Inc. that long benefited from supply chains that run through China are now paying a price for the country’ s sweeping lockdowns that have confined millions to their homes. Texas Instruments, which supplies semiconductors to automakers and tech companies, cut its revenue forecast Tuesday by about 10% because customers shuttered plants and reduced operating levels in China. The same day, Microsoft said the current lockdowns have affected its performance and extended shutdowns would hurt its ability to produce Xbox game consoles and Surface laptops. South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. warned Wednesday that any recovery in the smartphone and computer markets hinges on China’ s policy approach to Covid-19. Hynix owns facilities in Wuxi and Chongqing, and supplies companies such as Apple Inc., whose largest iPhone manufacturing facility is in Zhengzhou. “ The biggest demand factor would be the lockdowns, ” said Myoungsoo Park, a Hynix marketing executive, referring to orders from companies with supply chains in China. “ Depending on how they unfold in the future, there will be <span class="weasel">some</span> questions that still remain with regard to the uncertainties over demand in the second half. ” For decades, companies shifted production into China because of the benefits of low-cost labor, a massive domestic market and supportive government policies. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook helped pioneer the China-centric model, building the world’ s most valuable company by centralizing assembly in the country as components <span class="passive">were shipped</span> in from <span class="weasel">around</span> the globe. But the Covid pandemic exposed risks from the strategy never before contemplated. Factories closed, while shipping costs surged. Lockdowns in Shanghai, a city of 25 million, have exacerbated the troubles, and now <span class="weasel">may</span> spread to Beijing. Xi Jinping’ s administration has embraced a strict Zero Covid policy to show the Communist Party’ s power in stopping the pandemic’ s spread. More broadly, China’ s policies for stamping out Covid are rippling the world’ s No. 2 economy, putting Beijing’ s 5.5% growth target increasingly in question. The uncertainty, coupled with inflationary pressures, <span class="passive">is expected</span> to hammer consumer demand for high-cost discretionary items like the smartphones, electric vehicles and laptops. China’ s industry regulator has vowed to keep the country’ s supply chain “ unimpeded ” following Xi’ s order to mitigate the pandemic’ s impact on the economy. Still, key industrial parks remain inaccessible for trucks. Scores of companies have addressed the impact of China’ s policies on earnings or have <span class="passive">been asked</span> about it in the past week, according to a Bloomberg review of conference call transcripts. They range from giants like General Electric Co. and Pepsico Inc. to lower-profile companies that play a critical role in global supply chains. AU Optronics Corp., a Taiwanese company whose customers include Samsung Electronics Co. and HP Inc., explained Tuesday that lockdowns in China have increased the complexity of everything from production to recruitment. “ The materials we lack can change every day, ” said Paul Peng, the company’ s chief executive. “ Today it would be chemical materials, tomorrow it would be something else. We have to monitor what materials we are short of on a daily basis. ” The company has lost 30% to 40% of its capacity at its business in Kunshan, while other Chinese units are under different levels of restrictions, Peng said. AU Optronics said it is difficult to give guidance for the second quarter because of the unpredictable situation. James Yang, president of Taiwan’ s Innolux Corp., explained that consequences of China’ s lockdowns will be far-reaching. “ The impact will <span class="weasel">continue</span> to show in the second and third quarter, ” said Yang, whose customers include Samsung and General Motors Co. Automakers have been hit too. Tesla Inc. lost about a month of work during the Shanghai shutdown. Continental AG, Europe’ s second-largest maker of car parts, lowered its growth forecast for global production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to a range of 4% to 6%, from 6% to 9% previously. While Texas Instruments cut its revenue outlook, the company said it isn’ t seeing widespread order cancellations. That <span class="weasel">may</span> suggest the problems are more about logistics than a broader drop in demand for electronics. “ There are many customers that are just shut down -- they’ re not taking deliveries, ” Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said in an interview. Microsoft reported strong earnings for the first quarter, driven by cloud computing services. But it flagged that its ability to source the Xbox and other hardware <span class="weasel">could</span> get hit if it remains challenging to move people and products <span class="weasel">around</span> China. “ Production delays even early in <span class="weasel">May</span> can obviously have a big impact on the quarter, ” said CFO Amy Hood. “ So, we’ re watching it. ” It’ s so far unclear how Apple, which depends on hundreds of suppliers throughout China, will be able to navigate the lockdowns. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company reports earnings April 28. Foxconn Technology Group, the primary assembler of iPhones, has said that its plant in central China has continued to operate despite a lockdown of the area. Called iPhone City, the facility has switched to a closed-loop system under which employees remain on site and can’ t travel widely. Under the local rules, workers for key businesses can commute with permits.</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Adidas AG</td><td>sneakernews</td><td>general</td><td>0.370</td><td>0.604</td><td>1</td><td>0.487</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td><div class="txt"> ADVERTISEMENT Craig Green has been met with overwhelming praise ever since his first show in 2013.

Soaring power prices have rattled energy companies across Europe with Germany's Uniper securing credit lines of up to $ 11 billion from parent Fortum and state bank KfW. RWE, another of the country's largest utilities, last week said it too had made provisions. In Britain, meantime, dozens of small suppliers have gone bust as a result of the price spikes. Energy companies typically hedge their sales of gas and electricity to cover price differences across different markets. The surge in European prices has left <span class="weasel">some</span> companies exposed, requiring them to deposit extra funds to cover margin payments tied to those hedges, known in market parlance as a margin call. `` STEAG is able to actively participate in market activities, also in the current market situation. We found suitable partners for handling our forward transactions at an early stage, '' it said in a statement, without elaborating. STEAG, which made 368 million euros in core profit on 2 billion euros of sales in 2020, said in November it had arranged follow-up financing with its creditors until the end of 2023. Unlike Uniper, STEAG said it does not <span class="weasel">plan to</span> turn to KfW for help. The scramble for credit underlines the growing impact of hugely volatile power and gas costs on companies and end-customers across Europe, where <span class="weasel">several</span> governments have launched, or are considering, emergency funding schemes to help the less well-off. The Dutch wholesale day-ahead contract has nearly quadrupled over the past 12 months. And at 244 euros per megawatt hour, German day-ahead wholesale power baseload is up more than fivefold during the same period. Margin calls arise when the gap between'spot ' power prices and the level at which utilities have sold their output on a forward basis becomes too wide, forcing them to post the margin as proof that they can deliver in the unlikely event of default. On delivery, those contracts are usually unwound and the money flows back to the utilities, which is business as usual as long as price swings are not too dramatic. However, recent volatility has changed this dynamic, leading utilities to seek more financial headroom. Co-owned by municipal utilities, STEAG <span class="passive">is based</span> in Essen, which is also home to larger groups E.ON and RWE as well as conglomerate Thyssenkrupp. STEAG is undergoing a strategic turnaround under which it will expand its focus on renewables, energy efficiency and so-called bridge technologies, most notably gas, while phasing out most of its coal-fired power plants in 2022.

The headquarters of Deutsche Bank AG reflected in the windows of an office building in the financial district of Frankfurt, Germany, on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023. Deutsche Bank vowed to increase profit and revenue further this year, after snapping a long streak of market share gains in trading in the final quarter of Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing's turnaround plan. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg, Bloomberg ( Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG’ s supervisory board is facing its biggest revamp in <span class="weasel">several</span> years as the majority of labor representatives are set to be replaced. Seven of the ten employee representatives on the lender’ s board have decided to leave the governance body, people familiar with the matter said. Only three incumbents — Jan Duscheck, Timo Heider and Manja Eifert — are seeking a renewal of their mandates. That would be the largest number of new appointments since at least 2018 for the board, which currently has 20 members. The staff representatives who will be leaving include Frank Werneke, who heads Germany’ s largest services trade union, Ver.di. Werneke has chosen to step down since he’ s preparing to take on a board mandate at another big German company, one person said. German corporate governance rules give staff representatives in large listed companies just under half of the supervisory board seats, ensuring they have a powerful voice in all strategic decisions. Deutsche Bank employees <span class="passive">are scheduled</span> to vote on new board candidates to replace the outgoing representatives on April 5. Representatives for Deutsche Bank and Werneke declined to comment. Martina Klee, who joined the board in 2008, confirmed she’ s leaving, while Duscheck confirmed he’ s running. The other employee representatives didn’ t respond to a request for comment. The board revamp <span class="weasel">may</span> <span class="weasel">continue</span> a month later when the terms of four shareholder representatives — Mayree Clark, Norbert Winkeljohann, John Thain and Michele Trogni — are set to end at the lender’ s annual general meeting on <span class="weasel">May</span> 17.

Continental acquires family-owned belting manufacturer WCCO Belting headquartered in Wahpeton, North Dakota, USA. With this acquisition, the technology company complements its conveyor belting customer portfolio and strengthens its Conveying Solutions business in the agricultural industry. Additionally, equipment manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and farmers will benefit from a combined product and service portfolio generating a full multi-tier offering that will <span class="weasel">enable</span> better <span class="weasel">support</span> and service. `` This strategic acquisition is a threefold perfect fit: portfolio, sales market and people.

Fueled by the mega-trend in global population growth, protein demand, and climate-change-induced crop pressure, Continental expects that global demand for food and feed will <span class="weasel">continue</span> to rise and change in the coming decades. World Business Council for Sustainable Development, FReSH insight report and the Boston Consulting Group estimate that the trend is also based on global rapid population growth in the global middle class: With nearly 5 billion people in 2030, their share will have increased almost fivefold over the past three decades. With a much larger global population, rising living standards, and a change in attitudes to nutrition, transparency, and sustainability, dietary habits are becoming more diverse and demanding worldwide. That's why Continental's ContiTech Group Sector continues to focus on growing their share in the agricultural industry. With three-fourths of WCCO's business in the agricultural industry the acquisition underlines the company's <span class="weasel">commitment</span>. WCCO's product portfolio has a strong market position, serves a complementary customer base, and enjoys a favorable global reputation. Additionally, combining both product portfolios generate a full multi-tier offering that enables better <span class="weasel">support</span> to manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and farmers. `` We <span class="weasel">intend</span> to leverage and grow our manufacturing capability to elevate Continental's opportunity in this area and to offer complete technical solutions to manufacturers and distributors with the goal to improve profitability and speed to market with new innovations and products '', explains Jim Hill, Head of the Group Sector's North American business. Song Qi, Head of ContiTech's Conveying Solutions Business Area adds that Continental will boost sales of high value specialty belts in the global marketplace as well as make use of Continentals global sales team to further expand WCCO Belting's business outside of the Americas. In his welcoming remarks Hill expressed his great pleasure: `` We are all delighted to welcome you, the experienced and dedicated WCCO employees, to our Continental team. I am convinced that we will learn from each other and grow together to best serve our customers ' needs. We both, Continental and WCCO, are striving for excellence and focus on a customer centric approach which unites us. '' Established in 1954, WCCO Belting has more than 300 employees. It manufactures and distributes farm machinery applications such as draper belts, baler belts, pickup belts, tube conveyor belts, merger belts, as well as industrial belt applications for material and package handling, recycling, forestry, and aggregates. `` We perfectly fit to Continental as we share the same passion for our industries. Everything we do is to better <span class="weasel">support</span> our current and prospective customers ' needs based on our longstanding experience and with our team's dedication contributing to the process of creating custom rubber products that impact businesses across the world. We are very much looking forward to our future common path, '' says WCCO Belting's CEO and President Tom Shorma. The company distributes to more than 20 countries. WCCO Belting is known for its belting innovation, which helps meet the unique needs of its customers <span class="weasel">around</span> the world. By designing each product according to the operational requirements of a specific application, the belts consistently outperform the industry standard in numerous product segments. This effectively lowers the total cost of ownership of equipment for operators. Continental has and will <span class="weasel">continue</span> to play a pioneering role in the modernization of agriculture, also as an experienced and reliable partner in the transformation toward Farm 2030. It all began with motorization and today extends to digitalization and automation, which <span class="passive">is associated</span> with a substantial increase in productivity and crop yields. Everyone is talking about smart farming - and it's no coincidence that Continental calls intelligent agriculture the nutrient for the field of the future. Since its foundation in 1871, Continental has helped shape the development of agriculture with numerous innovations in rubber, plastic, sensor technology and electronics - from hoof buffers for horses through to autonomous field robots.

Zelenskyy shared his comments on Twitter after the leaders held a phone call to discuss Canada's controversial decision to send repaired parts of a Russian natural gas pipeline back to Germany. In a short statement, Zelenskyy said he thanked Trudeau for the continued powerful defense <span class="weasel">support</span>, but also spoke about the importance of upholding the sanctions. `` After the terrorist attacks in Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, Chasiv Yar, etc. the pressure must be increased, not decreased, '' he said. An official account of the discussion has not yet <span class="passive">been released</span> by the prime minister's office. Canada agreed earlier this month to grant an exemption to the economic sanctions issued against Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The two-year waiver would allow six Siemens Energy turbines, which were in Montreal for repairs, to be returned to Germany for use in the Russian state-owned Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Trudeau has previously defended the decision and said Canada's German ally relies on the natural gas supply from the pipeline. In a written and video address last week, however, Zelenskyy called the move `` absolutely unacceptable. '' Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom reduced gas deliveries from its Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which runs to northeastern Germany, by 60% last month, citing turbine-related technical problems. The Ottawa chapter of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress has planned a protest on Parliament Hill on Sunday afternoon to urge the government to revoke the waiver. `` Both Canada and Germany, we feel, have <span class="passive">been manipulated</span> here by the Russians, '' said Ukrainian Congress national executive director Ihor Michalchyshyn ahead of the planned protest. The group contends Canada bowed to Russian blackmail and set a dangerous precedent that will lead to the weakening of the sanctions regime imposed on Russia. `` This is a decision that has angered Canadians and the Ukrainian government as well, '' Michalchyshyn said. He said Ukrainian-Canadians involved in his group initially expressed surprise and disappointment when they learned that Canada would allow the turbines to be returned.

Attendees view the Mercedes-Benz AG EQG luxury electric sports utility vehicle ( SUV) displayed during an unveiling event ahead of the IAA Munich Motor Show in Munich, Germany, on Sunday, Sept. 5, 2021. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg, Bloomberg ( Bloomberg) -- Mercedes-Benz AG’ s upcoming electric G-Class will offer latest battery technology to bolster the distance the off-road icon can <span class="weasel">drive</span> on one charge. Mercedes will incorporate materials developed by California’ s Sila Nanotechnolgies Inc. as an option for a range-extended version of the vehicle from <span class="weasel">around</span> 2025, it said Tuesday. Sila makes a silicon anode material that goes into battery cells, boosting the amount of energy they can store. “ Delivering such a high energy density is a true game changer and allows us to think in completely new directions when developing future electric cars, ” Mercedes Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer said in a statement. Battery technology has become a key battleground for automakers looking to overcome consumers’ anxieties over electric-vehicle ranges. Mercedes in 2019 invested in Sila -- which is among <span class="weasel">several</span> firms trying to substantially improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries -- to supply future models. The G-Class is among the most expensive cars in the Mercedes range, playing an increasingly important role in the manufacturer’ s strategy of boosting margins to help fund its transition to EV technology. When a battery <span class="passive">is charged</span>, ions flow from the cathode to the anode. When it’ s discharged, the ions reverse course. The conventional anode material is graphite, but researchers have been looking at silicon as an alternative to develop a battery that can pack more energy. While Mercedes-Benz didn’ t provide an update on the electric G-Class’ s range, it said Sila’ s technology would boost battery energy density by as much as 40%. When Mercedes came up with the G-Class in the late 1970s, its boxy design and all-terrain capabilities <span class="passive">were envisioned</span> for soldiers and explorers. It largely stayed in that niche until the SUV boom vaulted the model more into to the mainstream, gaining high-profile customers including Sylvester Stallone, Kim Kardashian and Megan Fox.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>BMW</td><td>bmw</td><td>tech</td><td>0.283</td><td>0.589</td><td>1</td><td>0.436</td><td>1</td><td>24</td><td>8</td><td><div class="txt">Art is not just a creative <span class="weasel">vision</span>; it also promotes social responsibility. And in doing so, it also promotes values such as inclusion, diversity and equality. Works by women artists have never been as visible on the art market as they are today. This does not necessarily mean, however, that women artists have anywhere near the place they deserve. For example, the Diversity of Artists in Major U.S. Museums research project, which examined data from 18 famous American art museums, shows that 87 percent of artists on display were male and 85 percent white. Women in the arts have been facing gender bias for centuries. Initiatives such as ArtGirlRising, a platform founded by Liezel Strauss, <span class="weasel">aim</span> to <span class="weasel">raise awareness</span> of these inequalities and provide a voice for emerging female artists to achieve more and fairer representation in museums, galleries, and auction houses. The cultural <span class="weasel">commitment</span> shown by the BMW Group over the past five decades has extended far beyond the design of BMW Art Cars by renowned artists ( ➜ Read more: The history of BMW Art Cars). It has expanded its portfolio to include collaborations with renowned musicians like Daniel Barenboim and Diana Damra, as well as young artists such as Samson Young and Leelee Chan, who left their artist studios behind to make the whole world their source of inspiration. BMW Group has <span class="passive">been involved</span> in hundreds of cultural initiatives worldwide for over half a century. In the arts, as well as in music & sound, in architecture and design. The BMW Group's Cultural Engagement co-initiates partnerships such as BMW Open Work by Frieze, the BMW Welt Jazz Award and the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors. The BMW Art <span class="weasel">Journey</span> is another initiative and has <span class="passive">been created</span> together with Art Basel to send artists on a creative <span class="weasel">journey</span> for their research work. In addition, the free “ Opera for All ” concert series in Berlin, Munich, Moscow and London <span class="passive">was launched</span> decades ago. Ms. Strauss, can you give us <span class="weasel">some</span> insight into the personal <span class="weasel">journey</span> that led you to create ArtGirlRising? I founded ArtGirlRising to highlight the underrepresentation of female artists. ArtGirlRising was born after I saw the # 5womenartists campaign by the National Museum of Women in the Arts. The T-shirts that we are making with women artists’ names on them will kick the conversation off and ultimately <span class="weasel">raise awareness</span> of the acute underrepresentation of women artists worldwide. One of the really big challenges at first was to get a handle on my anger when I saw the statistics about the percentage of women in the art world. This left me speechless and disheartened. I still find it difficult to comprehend to this day. I’ ve been in the art world for nearly two decades, and when I started ArtGirlRising almost four years ago, I wasn’ t even aware of these staggering numbers. The pandemic also often left us with our backs against the wall, but we managed to develop other revenue streams and <span class="weasel">support</span> artists through affordable online courses and workshops on art, the business of art, and women’ s advocacy. Our current focus is on partnerships with art museums and art organizations, such as BMW Group Culture, to create broad awareness. ArtGirlRising has become a movement. The printed T-shirts were the starting point, but the goal now is to also create a place where women artists can find advice, opportunities, community, representation, and more. All the time! I run my organizations and businesses very much from the heart and by intuition. Things don’ t always go well financially, but at the end of the day, we’ re community-focused. I know there will always be challenges, but I work with incredible people, and together we try to find the most meaningful and sustainable ways and solutions. I think the art world is really missing out. Art <span class="weasel">should</span> be one of the leading forces in imagining a better world and a better future. At the moment though it is not fulfilling this function. When art galleries, museums, art fairs, and auction houses <span class="passive">are dominated</span> by white, male artists, there is a huge gap in imagining a better world and future because only a very small cross section of the world is being shown. The new generation has social media and access to resources and information – which although invaluable, primarily only helps with awareness. The new generation often does not have the influence needed to effect change from the top down. We need the new generation to <span class="weasel">raise awareness</span>, do the research and create the momentum – and then we need partnerships with <span class="weasel">vision</span> to make the change happen. By researching, providing the data, continuing to <span class="weasel">raise awareness</span>, and then: act, act, act. We all need to know the numbers. There is simply not enough data available. The art world needs to become more transparent in this regard, both in public art institutions and in the commercial market. We need more people to research and publish the numbers, and then we need ways to communicate the inequality and ultimately use this to bring about change. ArtGirlRising has designed a limited edition of its signature T-shirt in collaboration with BMW Group Culture. We briefly introduce three of the five female artists presented on it and their reflections on the appreciation of women in art. British artist Abigail Reynolds, winner of the BMW Art <span class="weasel">Journey</span> 2016, brought together the results of her findings in her “ The Ruins of Time: Lost Libraries of the Silk Road ” series of works during a <span class="weasel">journey</span> along the Silk Road. The five-month research trip was a formative event for Reynolds. She likes works that create space for questions and are open-ended: “ Every artist tries to follow a line of desire. It’ s not just about the work you want to do; it’ s about the life you want to <span class="weasel">support</span> with your art. Making the <span class="weasel">journey</span> to lost libraries from Xi'an in China to Herculaneum in Italy along the ancient Silk Road – on a motorbike – was a life-changing experience. ” When it comes to equal representation and museums, galleries and auction houses are still far from providing a satisfactory response, she reveals: “ I attended a state school and then went to Oxford University, a decision I made largely because I was curious about privilege and power structures. I wanted to see them in action with my own eyes. I see that very little has changed in my life. All too many people do not have opportunities. Gender and ethnicity are not the only factors, although these are still real barriers. The art world is global and diverse, and many people in the sector are making sincere efforts to address these imbalances. Nevertheless, I find that the art world and academia are very tokenistic in the way they act. I think I probably dislike this even more than openly-expressed prejudice, because it’ s harder to counter, and because it’ s fundamentally dishonest. ” Tonia Calderon lives and works in Los Angeles. She often employs borderless textures and surfaces in her visual works that force the viewer to question, feel, and reflect. Because conscious material selection ( ➜ Read more: The BMW iX3 rim as canvas) <span class="passive">is inspired</span> by personal life experiences, relationships and the multicultural background of the artist, who has Mexican, Dutch, Indonesian and Chinese ancestry. She began working as an independent artist at 19, moonlighting as a bartender, and she purchased a home in Arizona as a safe anchor immediately after graduating from high school: “ If there was one thing I was sure of as a young woman, it was that I would do whatever it took to <span class="weasel">support</span> myself. ” When the real estate market collapsed though, she had to reevaluate her notions of stability and security – and moved to Los Angeles to devote herself to being a full-time artist. When it comes to equal rights for female artists, however, Calderon now sees a lot of catching up to do in the here-and-now. “ True equality is a distant goal in terms of how women <span class="passive">are represented</span> and valued in museums and galleries. Conversation and awareness are a great start – but as long as we see that inequalities are still alive and thriving in our society, we can assume that those same inequalities will be reflected in art. The best way to combat inequality is through education and, more importantly, representation. Those of us fortunate enough to have a career in the arts in these times have a duty to change the picture. Children – future artists, creators, inventors and builders – are witness to the paths we pave. I hope I can help <span class="weasel">encourage</span> future artists and children to become the best versions of themselves that they are capable of with my art and visibility. ” Leelee Chan became the ninth winner of the BMW Art <span class="weasel">Journey</span> in 2020, dedicating “ Tokens From Time ” to material culture from the past, present and future. In this context, the topics of environment and cultural sustainability particularly <span class="weasel">drive</span> her creativity. The artist engages in dialog with scientists and experts on her <span class="weasel">journey</span> to gain a deeper understanding of how natural materials can be sustainably replaced by man-made materials in the future. The defining moment of her personal Art <span class="weasel">Journey</span> was her return home. “ Thirteen years after leaving Hong Kong, I <span class="passive">was presented</span> with an opportunity to re-<span class="weasel">explore</span> my roots while moving my sculptural practice forward. That was a turning point for me. When I moved back to Hong Kong, sculpture became my main medium. ” Even though Chan is now one of the established greats in her field, she sees an urgent need for representation and appreciation of female artists. “ There is no doubt that there is still <span class="weasel">significant</span> gender imbalance in the art world – there have been a lot of statistics published and discussed over the last decade to confirm this. In the last few years, I 've noticed that there are a lot more conversations going on and that people have started to become aware of this inequality and address issues of gender representation. ” Still, she said, it can be very frustrating at times to think about how much still needs to change – especially in terms of the institutional system, cultural biases, gender stereotypes and the sexism of aging. Chan is upbeat about the future though: “ Even if it seems that <span class="weasel">progress</span> is not fast enough, I can <span class="weasel">consider</span> myself lucky compared to the generations of female artists that went before me. I’ m also glad that I have the opportunity to surround myself with strong women who are working every day to overcome <span class="weasel">some</span> of the historical biases and change the art world from the inside out. That gives me hope. ” We use cookies to optimise and continuously improve our website for individual users like you.

The summer before my final year at Central Saint Martins, I went home; I felt really nostalgic as I sorted through our old stuff. I felt that every object had a story and feeling behind it, and I wanted to honour that. So I started taking apart a lot of my old sports equipment and creating forms with it. I took my soccer sneakers apart and draped them until they reminded me of a corset. It created an armoured look, and that’ s what ignited the upcycling in my work. ” “ I think that the main thing I learned from him was his ability to stay authentic to the story and <span class="weasel">vision</span> of each collection: Every season had its own concept, whether people recognized it or not. As a designer, he always remained faithful to it and ensured that the rest of his team was also committed to the narrative and the women we were designing it for.

However through Government <span class="weasel">support</span> for more efficient heating and lower carbon technologies, homeowners <span class="weasel">could</span> claim back up to £8,911 over a seven-year period [ 2 ]. Nigel Dewbery, Head of Energy Efficiency at E.ON, said: “ Air source heat pumps are an ideal solution for homeowners in more rural areas or who are off the gas grid and rely on oil or LPG. “ According to the Energy Savings Trust, homeowners who currently fuel their homes with a G-rated oil boiler <span class="weasel">could</span> <span class="weasel">potentially</span> save up to £315 a year on their annual fuel bills by installing an air source heat pump.

As well as a range of exciting technological solutions, like air source heat pumps, solar panels and domestic batteries, we also offer tips, tools and smart meters that can all help customers to better understand and manage their home energy use. ” Air source heat pumps use electricity to extract heat from the outside air, in the same way a refrigerator extracts heat to keep the inside cool. Heat from the air can be extracted even when temperatures are as low as -15° C and can be used to heat both the home and the hot water tank. The installation of an air source heat pump usually takes up to three days and comes with a seven year manufacturer’ s warranty to offer peace of mind to customers [ 4 ]. E.ON is currently installing the new technology in Norfolk, Suffolk and Lincolnshire and hopes to offer it more widely in early 2018. Homeowners can visit eoninstall.com/heatpump to find out more information about air source heat pumps and how to register for a free, no obligation survey. Once they register their interest, E.ON will visit the applicant’ s home carry out a free home assessment to check whether an air source heat pump would be the right option for their home and if so to discuss next steps.

Hong Kong used mainland China’ s “ zero-Covid ” strategy to keep the virus at bay. By Published For the last eight years Mathilde and her family have called Hong Kong home, but as the coronavirus tears through the city they are joining an exodus of foreign workers looking for an escape route. “ We are leaving and we will come back to empty our house whenever that is possible, ” she told AFP, declining to give her surname and nationality. “ All our close friends are leaving. ” For Mathilde it was the risk of <span class="passive">being separated</span> from her three Hong Kong-born children that was the final straw after two years of tough “ zero-Covid ” restrictions. “ We want to get our children out of here above all, ” she said. Hong Kong used mainland China’ s “ zero-Covid ” strategy to keep the virus at bay, until the highly infectious Omicron variant broke through at the start of the year.

All 7.4 million residents will be tested later this month and authorities are building a network of isolation camps to house the infected, deepening fears that families will be separated in the months ahead. As a result, departures have skyrocketed with a net outflow of 71,000 people — including 63,000 residents — in February, the highest since the pandemic began. – ‘ No road map’ – Travel restrictions have been hard on Hong Kong’ s foreign workers, who make up nearly 10 percent of the population.

She’ s met her grandparents only once, ” he sighed. Lucy Porter Jordan, a sociologist at the University of Hong Kong, said that, before Omicron, Hong Kong “ had the restrictions but you also had the safety ”. “ If you take that out of the equation, you end up with this kind of perfect storm. ” Most of those leaving, she added, were people with children and “ people that have the means ”. Over the last fortnight Hong Kong has looked more like New York or London at the start of the pandemic than a city which had two years of hard-won breathing room to get ready. The government was caught flat-footed with few plans in place to deal with a mass Omicron-fuelled outbreak. Hospitals and morgues were quickly overwhelmed and the city’ s current death rate is four times Singapore’ s, mostly accounted for by unvaccinated elderly residents. Panic buying has stripped shelves bare, schools remain shuttered and summer holidays have been brought forward so classrooms can be used for mass testing. – Talent drain – Companies and industry groups have been increasingly public in their talent-drain warnings. The European Union’ s local office estimates 10 percent of its nationals have left since the pandemic began. Multiple airlines have reported a surge of bookings in recent weeks while shipping container prices have doubled in a year. International shipping company SendMyBag told AFP outbound shipments from Hong Kong have increased four-fold compared with 2021. “ Everybody is looking for tickets to go, people are fighting for the containers, ” said Lin, a mother of two grown children who declined to give her nationality. Lin is looking to move to Dubai after 12 years in Hong Kong and said many of her colleagues were doing the same. “ A friend who’ s leaving next week had a three-year-old BMW and she said ‘ You know what, I’ m just giving it to charity because no one will buy it anyway. ' ” The current exodus adds to a wave of migration already under way of local Hong Kongers, which began after China cracked down against democracy protests. Between June 2020 and June 2021 Hong Kong saw its biggest population decrease in 60 years, and there is little sign of that changing. “ We are now only in the starting period of this wave, ” said Chung Kim-wah, head of Hong Kong’ s Public Opinion Research Institute. “ Many more young people will choose to move away if they have a chance ”.

Cooling towers emit vapor at the Niederaussem lignite fueled power station, operated by RWE AG, beyond a wind turbine in Bergheim Niederaussem, Germany, on Friday, April 8, 2022. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck last week said the country has already cut its reliance on Russian coal by at least half in the past month as the European Union agreed to ban imports of the fuel from Russia., Bloomberg ( Bloomberg) -- European regulators have launched a joint review to map out the prevalence of greenwashing in the financial industry. The three European Supervisory Authorities ( ESAs) issued a 42-page “ call for evidence ” to gauge the scale of exaggerated environmental, social and governance investing statements as they try to find out how well existing regulations are working. The move, announced on Tuesday, acts on a mandate by the European Commission that was given in <span class="weasel">May</span>. The probe coincides with a wave of ESG fund reclassifications as asset managers react to clarifications to the EU’ s anti-greenwash rulebook, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. In an effort to navigate the new landscape, investment firms are increasingly relying on lawyers, according to those representing the industry. The ESA review targets banks, insurers, pensions, benchmark administrators, asset managers and investors. The regulators have asked the financial market participants to respond to questions relating to everything from senior management’ s role in sustainability to “ underlying drivers of greenwashing. ” Firms are also expected to provide examples. In an apparent effort to allay fears of the legal repercussions of providing responses, the ESAs made clear that reported examples of greenwashing would be used to advise the commission on possible remedies. “ The purpose of this survey is to gather useful and concrete examples that will help the ESAs to better understand greenwashing, ” according to the document. Reported greenwashing cases “ are mainly sought for the purpose of informing the advice which the ESAs would provide to the European Commission. ” Those responding “ <span class="weasel">may</span> either give full details about the actual names of the entities or products involved in a potential greenwashing practice, or you <span class="weasel">may</span> refer to them as ‘ entity X’, ‘ product Y’. ” The ESAs <span class="passive">are scheduled</span> to deliver an initial report by <span class="weasel">May</span> 31 and a final report a year later.

This mid-year update from the excellent Climate Tech VC newsletter suggests there were roughly 250 deals this year as of June 30, representing about $ 16 billion in funding. One data point you’ ll appreciate: There were 50 percent more contracts disclosed during the second quarter, compared with a year earlier; although last year many investors held on to their money during the COVID-19 uncertainty, so <span class="weasel">consider</span> that stat with caution. Still, that amount is just what has already been specifically dedicated to startups and ventures. There’ s beaucoup more moolah waiting in the wings — swelling private equity funds such as Brookfield’ s Global Transition Fund ( with $ 7 billion to start) and the TPG Rise Climate Fund ( with $ 5.4 billion). Investors who participated in the cleantech movement observe one big thing that makes the current spending spree different: the participation of traditional investors who have become interested in the economic opportunity linked to addressing climate change. `` Climate tech is much broader and includes things that cleantech would not have counted, '' said Valerie Shen, partner and COO of G2 Venture Partners, which recently closed its second $ 500 million fund dedicated to climate tech. At least half the firm’ s limited partners are actively engaged in `` searching for the sustainability piece, '' and the fund tracks the carbon emissions impact of its portfolio on an annual basis. Shen added: `` There is a realization that so many things are heavily impactful for climate. '' Over the past year, the `` extreme politicization '' of climate discussions has started to shift, another reason for the mainstream shift, noted Andrew Beebe, managing director of Obvious Ventures. `` All sides are recognizing that this is a non-partisan issue in the problem statement, '' he told me. `` When those things happen, investors start to recognize the foundation. When there is massive upheaval, there’ s usually massive amounts of money to be made. '' One more reason for the shift in perspective, Beebe suggests, is the increasingly `` world positive '' perspective of Generation Z. A growing number of entrepreneurs and founders are considering climate change and the decarbonization of the economy as part of their core value proposition. `` This <span class="weasel">could</span> change every single aspect of the way that we move goods and people, '' he observed. Naturally, the monetary <span class="weasel">support</span> flowing into climate tech startups is coming in many shapes, reflecting the increasingly diverse and mainstream nature of the opportunity. One intriguing model that came to my attention earlier this month <span class="passive">is embraced</span> by BCG Green Ventures, a newly created climate tech incubation program that’ s part of Boston Consulting Group’ s digital ventures arm. The mandate: Partner with corporations to help them identify business opportunities related to climate tech, then jointly incubate and invest in those ventures. The effort evolved out of inquiries to BCG’ s broader venture arm, which has helped build close to 160 businesses ranging from an artificial intelligence-power lab assistant to an online used car platform ( which it created in collaboration with Volkswagen). `` The businesses we build will tackle both the operational decarbonization side of the equation, addressing both Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and the opportunity angle, supporting corporates through the inception and growth of new, green revenue streams, '' wrote Stefan Gross-Selbeck, global managing director and senior partners of BCG Digital Ventures, in a blog announcing the BCG Green Ventures initiative. When I spoke with Gross-Selbeck, he said the idea is to `` combine the speed and agility of a startup with the traditional assets of a much larger corporation. '' Typically BCG is responsible for recruiting talent, and helping teams manage project and development cycles. Most of the funding comes from the corporate partner, and the BCG ventures team <span class="passive">is compensated</span> for meeting certain key performance indicators. <span class="weasel">Several</span> projects are already under way. Utopus Insights, a partnership with IBM, is a software company that uses energy analytics to help integrate renewable power into the grid. OpenSC is a supply chain traceability platform that BCG developed in collaboration with WWF. Another example is SiFAB, which is working on silicon anode materials technologies that <span class="weasel">could</span> result in denser batteries and charge more quickly and have a longer life. The corporate partner is Unifrax, a specialty materials company. Many of these companies will have access to BCG CO2, a software tool built by BCG that helps organizations track greenhouse gas emissions along their entire value chain. While BCG’ s new initiative has a broad purview, Gross-Selbeck said that many initial projects will center on using artificial intelligence and other digital technologies to help more quickly identify and optimize breakthroughs for mobility and materials. `` Generally speaking, we <span class="weasel">believe</span> that 70 percent to 80 percent of what needs to be achieved can be achieved by scaling up existing technology, '' he said. Gross-Selbeck believes you can think of these things as falling into Scope 4 ( what?) on the GHG spectrum, representing developments that help companies begin to more credibly build their stories <span class="weasel">around</span> the `` avoided emissions '' associated with their products and services.

Maria Tudorica coordinates the leasing strategy for Genesis Property’ s 150,000+ square foot office portfolio in her role as Commercial Real Estate Manager. With extensive experience in leading real estate companies and a Masters in Business Administration with a specialization in Behavioral Economics, Maria manages a successful collaboration with existing tenants and develops new leasing opportunities, using her expertise to develop customer-centric forecasts and solutions. ” The office plays an essential role in supporting the fine balance between professional and personal life, and employees now want more facilities and options to enrich their experience at the workplace. The office will become a complex destination, a platform enabling communities of like-minded people to work, live, and have fun together. In this new context, co-living and co-working spaces have become two fundamental pillars aligned to this direction, addressing the need for flexibility and dynamism. We will talk more about these topics on 19 July at Realty Forum. ” Maria Tudorica told BR. Returning to the office and defining the future working style has changed employees’ perceptions of their office. Romanians want offices where they have options for networking and interacting both at work and in their free time, a trend that is increasingly visible <span class="weasel">around</span> the world. Thus, for 77% of Romanian employees, the ideal office <span class="weasel">should</span> be located in an area surrounded by green spaces, offering leisure facilities, according to a recent survey of 1,180 employees by Genesis Property, conducted nationwide in April-<span class="weasel">May</span> 2022. ” People’ s working and living styles have changed over the last two years and have created new expectations regarding the way they carry out their activities. Employees now want more flexibility and work-life balance and value their time off more than ever. A multifunctional hub, with office space and facilities beyond the office, thus becomes the link between the two dimensions, integrating all the activities that matter ”, said Maria Tudorică, Comercial Real Estate Manager at Genesis Property. Genesis Property is a leader in Class A office development in Romania, with almost 20 years of experience in the real estate industry. Genesis Property owns and operates over 150,000 square meters of prime commercial real estate space for blue-chip clients such as HP, Accenture, Societe Generale, Citibank, Ericsson, Garanti BBVA, Infineon, Luxoft, Yokogawa, Siemens and Alpha Bank, where more than 20,000 employees work. In 2020, Genesis Property launched IMMUNE Building Standard™, an innovative global standard that certifies the resilience of buildings to health threats such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Through IMMUNE™, the company aims to contribute sustainably to the creation of the healthy buildings of the future. Genesis Property is also the developer of the first private student campus in Romania, West Gate Studios, and a 4-star accommodation unit, Studio One Accommodation Suites.

But there are steps in the right direction and nuances within sustainability ‘ misses’ which, if built on, will generate needed momentum. Many fashion brands have been sharing their sustainability ambitions and activities far and wide in recent years, using large marketing campaigns to demonstrate their ‘ positive’ contribution. However, with six out of every ten fashion brands being found to be greenwashing and many still feeding overproduction, it is clear why campaign groups and lobbyists would get so worked up. But is this part of a broader story? Is there anything worthy to be said about brands’ sustainability efforts, even when they smack of greenwashing? This <span class="weasel">may</span> seem, at first sight, to be contradictory. With the tough target of meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, we need companies to be genuinely pulling together, not hiding behind flimsy claims. Many would also argue that the fashion industry is not <span class="passive">being judged</span> harshly enough and gets away with a lot. But there are steps in the right direction and nuances within sustainability ‘ misses’ which, if built on, will generate positive momentum. Heading up fashion purpose accounts at Given ( we work with brands that have a genuine ambition to be purpose-driven), I see firsthand how businesses including John Lewis & Partners, IKEA, Zalando and Tommy Hilfiger are tackling the challenge. Many within the industry are working to identify new ways forward — enforcing strict standards within their supply chains to govern materials, production, processes, and sourcing, as well as employee safety and protection. While there <span class="weasel">should</span> be no compromise on the latter, making fashion truly environmentally and socially sustainable requires long-term thinking and a massive culture shift. Yet, many fashion brands today have <span class="passive">been created</span> to operate at speed — focusing on trends not quality; and fueling the desire to buy, buy, buy. As these brands run highly compartmentalised sustainability projects that can be delivered rapidly, the main goal is often to <span class="weasel">drive</span> greater sales and reassure the young and fashionable that a collection is better for the planet ( read: less harmful), rather than to actually create positive impacts. These small changes <span class="weasel">may</span> be in the right direction; but they barely scratch the surface of the damage fashion is causing to the planet and are not sufficient to move the sustainability dial. Learn more about the nuances and complexity of greenwashing and how to avoid them at Brand-Led Culture Change — <span class="weasel">May</span> 22-24 in Minneapolis. I am a firm believer in taking a long-term view and being careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water in the short run. Unfortunately, fashion at present is an industry whose use of labour arbitrage in low-cost nations, dubious working practices and heavy carbon footprint mean it still does more harm than good. In such a context, even the slightest improvements <span class="weasel">should</span> be heralded. Like sport, music and movies, fashion has a disproportionate influence over the behaviours of its followers — therefore, bringing the sustainability conversation to the public is a valuable first step that can be built on to create further gains. The effect on consumers <span class="weasel">should</span> not be underestimated. But regardless of the value of engaging consumers in sustainability, we can’ t ignore the contradictions <span class="passive">being perpetuated</span> by the same brands — with overconsumption now being the biggest elephant in the room when it comes to sustainable fashion. In sustainable fashion marketing, the overconsumption piece often does not seem to matter — as seen by the fact that Primark, H & M and Nike were all voted in the top 5 most sustainable brands by the public in 2022. Currently, sustainable fashion initiatives targeted towards customers are often focused on what garments are made from, not about how many pieces they buy or who made them. The marketing skills fashion brands have employed to capture the imaginations of consumers <span class="weasel">should</span> be turned to tackle overconsumption — and they <span class="weasel">could</span> start with the language they use and the stories they tell. I <span class="weasel">believe</span> there is a need for new language and words to explain what sustainable fashion actually is. The word ‘ fashion’ itself implies clothing that is cyclic and transient, that needs to be changed with the seasons and with fading trends. The reality is, we can wear anything we like, whenever we like — and this timeless positioning will help <span class="weasel">promote</span> a more sustainable approach to apparel and move away from overconsumption. We <span class="weasel">should</span> also look at ‘ the stories’ clothes tell. Truly sustainable fashion brands tend to be small and people-focused, tapping into the demand of their customers to reclaim stories about the clothes they wear. While fast fashion moves wearers away from communities and becomes about isolation and globalisation, ethical brands are about communities and being in tune with how people feel. There are also other ways to imbibe sustainable fashion with stories: Companies such as Depop and eBay add stories by allowing the wearer to layer a historical, ‘ second time <span class="weasel">around</span>’ narrative onto the clothes they wear. It is through these stories and language that sustainable fashion can be better understood and bought-into. That in turn will <span class="weasel">drive</span> the industry’ s true <span class="weasel">progress</span>. 20 years ago, we never thought we 'd see fast fashion brands talk about sustainability. So, when it comes to fashion’ s sustainability story, let’ s not be so focused on looking for evidence of greenwashing — what’ s important is that the seed of <span class="weasel">progress</span> is there. But now, in this pressing decade for change, let's push for and embrace a new narrative that gives us the confidence to break the shackles of cyclical fashion trends.

A lovely dynamic database input system that responds beautifully by giving you only the pages which you actually need to fill in, without absolutely hiding the rest of it ( for the curious), and which also gives you a `` printer ready '' version of the data and facts provided which you are legally required to keep for however many years ( I think it's 7) because you have attested to the veracity of the information you 've given ( and you <span class="weasel">could</span> end up going to jail if it's wrong or you 've lied). And you can then show said completed paper forms to even the dodderyist old fart of an accountant who will understand them in seconds because they 've seen thousands of the over the years and know exactly that you have to double check that the boxes on pages 2,3 & 5 <span class="weasel">should</span> add up to the total in box C of Page 9. I don't know who did their move online, but I 'd like to shake their hand and buy them a pint ( in a tax deductible and expenses legitimate way of course). I tell you what though... I 'd rather print out a PDF form, fill it in with a biro, scan it and send it back than try to fill in the same form sent as a word document which they expect you to TYPE into. And that goes treble if instead of using Word's clunky form field system they 've just used a mixture of tabs, spaces, underscores, underlining, paragraph marks and new line marks to create blank / ruled space on the page, whether they 've used page, column and section breaks or not. AND I expect they 've inserted helpful guidance text in a light grey which you then have to overtype, but the document was sent with insert mode on because that's how everyone uses Word and setting it to overtype would just confuse 99% of the recipients who don't even know that such a mode exists. I 'm far too anal to return any kind of a Word document where filling it in destroys the pagination, and where any data so collected are going to be e.g. exported into ( God forbid but as soon as you see one of these you know what's going to happen to it) an Excel spreadsheet, but NOT by exporting a separated data layer as something sensible like XML or CSV, but by copying and pasting text which <span class="weasel">may</span> or <span class="weasel">may</span> not include formatting and rogue characters which is THEN going to require a whole lot of data sanitation to be performed, something which Excel sucks at worse than anything. If they 've made work for themselves using such a ridiculous methodology, then I don't see why I <span class="weasel">should</span> waste any more than the bare minimum of my time. Ah. It's not the 90% of case that are simple that add the complexity that slows everything down... it's the 10% of cases where you have to navigate the labyrinthine tax laws that screw it all up.

I worked at a hospital which had to leave portable x-ray machines in a basement corridor that was open for general use ( though not advertised!) Signs of increasing levels of frustration and anger appeared over the years instructing, warning, begging and even pleading for people NOT to mess with the controls. The last new notice I saw ( which obviously was the one that worked) said `` Please feel free to play with these controls - we are short of bodies for dissection classes '' Ah, sorry. I had to go out on a job yesterday morning and it was quite involved, so I stopped checking for about an hour. When I picked it up again... Oh yes, and the bit about strikes is that they hid, and according to Liz's interview last night are still pursuing, legislation to yet again restrict civil liberties instead of addressing the issue. Stick for the strikers, carrots for the bankers.

The nation had a number of problems, the cause seems to be very high inflation caused primarily by fuel prices resulting from the Ukraine situation. This inflation led to strikes, increasing poverty levels, decreasing health levels etc. They had the opportunity to address <span class="weasel">some</span> of that, but they did crazy things - leaving personal allowances alone for one. The 20% to 19% change put £2 a month in the pay packet of someone age 23 working full time on minimum wage. That's way less than a monthly bus ticket has gone up. I catch a bus fairly often; it goes past a hospital - I see half a dozen nurses or care/health assistants on every trip. Someone up at the TOP of that 20% band, <span class="weasel">around</span> £50kpa, gets <span class="weasel">around</span> £30 a month from that percentage change. Raising the personal allowance up by £150 costs the treasury exactly the same but puts £12 a month into the pocket of everyone earning under £100k. Sounds like pants when you're on £4k a month, but that £12 means choice like do you get a cheaper bottle of wine to go with Sunday dinner, not `` Well, looks like it's a choice of a bus ticket or taking lunch to work ''. But of course% basic rates look sexier in the headlines than personal allowance figure which are just a blah blah string of numbers. And don't even get me started on the pain of mortgage interest rates now... they 've screwed the pooch and that doesn't get unscrewed. The damage is done.

James Polzin, 47, <span class="passive">is accused</span> of filing fraudulent applications for government loans by claiming `` nonexistent employees and revenues for businesses he supposedly owned and operated. '' CNN revealed earlier this month that Polzin obtained at least six loans worth roughly $ 1.2 million from the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP), which <span class="passive">was intended</span> to help companies pay workers during the pandemic.

Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken The criminal charges stemmed from three additional loans adding up to <span class="weasel">around</span> $ 450,000 granted under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan ( EIDL) program, another SBA initiative intended specifically for businesses that lost revenue due to Covid-19. The same businesses that obtained these loans also received PPP loans, and the government cited CNN's reporting in its complaint, but Polzin has not been specifically charged with PPP loan fraud. Read More The government alleges that Polzin purchased an Arizona house in June with nearly $ 400,000 in cash, at least partially funded by proceeds from both EIDL and PPP loans, according to the government. Polzin bought a Porsche the same month, according to government filings, which did not specify whether Covid-19 relief funds <span class="passive">were used</span> for this purchase. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation unit are investigating Polzin, who is now in federal custody, according to a press release. The government convinced a judge that Polzin was a flight risk, noting in court filings that Polzin <span class="passive">is married</span> to a Ukrainian citizen and spends much of his time overseas. He allegedly sold his Porsche for $ 120,000 the day before he <span class="passive">was arrested</span> last week, <span class="weasel">around</span> two weeks after CNN's investigation, while he was on his way to the airport with a one-way ticket to Ukraine.

The government investigation did not find evidence of legitimate business operations, and many former clients told CNN that Polzin took their money and never submitted their taxes or filed them incorrectly. He has upset so many people that a Facebook group dedicated to his alleged misdeeds has garnered more than 100 members.

His departure from the role marks a changing of the guard at Merck, which Frazier, 66, has run since 2011. He will hand the reins to Robert Davis, currently Merck's chief financial officer, who was unanimously elected by the board of directors to serve as CEO beginning July 1. `` We are making this leadership change secure in the knowledge that Merck has the elements in place for a strong future of scientific innovation and profitable growth, '' Frazier said on a Thursday conference call. Frazier will <span class="weasel">continue</span> to serve as executive chairman of Merck's board for a unspecificed, transition period. In addition to the switch at CEO, Merck's research chief Roger Perlmutter retired last month after seven years as head of the company's laboratories and <span class="passive">was replaced</span> by Dean Li. Under Frazier and Perlmutter, Merck has grown steadily over the past five years despite fierce competition and accelerating industry consolidation that swelled the size of its peers. Much of the company's recent success is due to Keytruda, an immunotherapy that's been at the forefront of a seismic shift in cancer research and treatment. The drug, brought into Merck's labs through the 2009 acquisition of Schering-Plough, helped the drugmaker rebound after many of the medicines that drove its business in the 2000s lost patent protection and market share. Seeing promising results from early studies of the drug, Frazier and Perlmutter poured resources into its development, hastening Merck's shift away from primary care medicines and into oncology. By last year, the company had launched more than 1,000 studies of Keytruda. Their decision paid off as Keytruda has become a mainstay treatment in lung, skin and a wide range of other cancers. Sales surpassed $ 14 billion last year, making up nearly a third of the company's roughly $ 48 billion in revenue. The total for Keytruda is more than double what Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck's long-time rival in cancer immunotherapy, earned in 2020 for its competing drug Opdivo. The Schering-Plough deal, worth $ 41 billion, was Merck's last of that size Frazier focused instead on smaller deals for early-stage drug prospects. But none have developed into anything like Keytruda, which was largely overlooked in the takeover of Schering-Plough. `` None of us was really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab, '' Frazier said Thursday, reference to the Keytruda's scientific name. Keytruda's development from an afterthought in a major pharmaceutical merger to one of the most successful drugs in the industry's history framed Frazier's tenure as Merck CEO. But his leadership carried beyond Merck's walls. He was a vocal defender of pharmaceutical companies and private capital funding of drug development in a period when public outrage over high prices made the industry one of the most loathed in America. `` I see my role as to optimize patient access to medicine and optimize a return on investment, not to maximize either, '' Frazier said in 2019 at an industry conference. `` I get criticized by people on the left, because I don't maximize the amount of drugs I can get to people. I can't do that and be able to raise money, '' he added. `` And people on the right will say, why are you giving the Ebola vaccine away? I 'm not trying to maximize profit. '' Unusually for a CEO in a risk-averse industry, Frazier also took public stands on divisive cultural and racial issues. In 2017, he was the first executive to resign from former President Donald Trump's manufacturing council after Trump refused to specifically denounce the White nationalists whose protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to the death of one woman and injury of over a dozen more. `` As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism, '' Frazier, one of just four Black CEOs in the Fortune 500, said in a statement then. More recently, following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis, Frazier has spoken out about racism in America and the role of a corporation in advocating for racial justice. Like other sectors, the drug industry is largely led by White men and has struggled to improve representation of women and people of color among managers and top executives. That's true at Merck, too, despite a diverse executive committee. `` We 've done a good job on diversity at the top, but we haven't had the pull through at the levels below that I think we need to have, '' Frazier told Harvard Business School's Tsedal Neeley in a July 2020 interview. `` And I take responsibility for that. '' Frazier joined Merck in 1992, rising through the ranks as a lawyer to become general counsel seven years later. He led the legal team that defended Merck against lawsuits over the safety of the company's pain drug Vioxx, which was withdrawn from market for causing heart attacks and strokes. Merck eventually settled, agreeing to pay $ 4.85 billion. `` I think if there's one lesson that I learned from Vioxx is that for a company like Merck you have to stand strong on your heritage, '' Frazier said in response to a question on Thursday. Merck, he said, needed to communicate `` the importance of what we do for the world and the integrity by which we do it. '' Frazier served as president of global human health at Merck from 2007 to 2010 before succeeding Richard Clark as CEO. In 2018, Merck canceled a policy that would have forced Frazier to retire at age 65, allowing him to stay on for longer. `` Given Merck's current position of strength, the Merck board and I <span class="weasel">believe</span> it's a good time to begin transitioning the company's day-to-day decision making as well as its strategic direction '' to Davis, Frazier said Thursday. Davis ' foremost task will be convincing investors Merck can sustain its growth after Keytruda loses market exclusivity at the end of the decade. The company touts <span class="weasel">several</span> experimental drugs, including a pneumococcal vaccine and an HIV medicine, as particularly promising, but none <span class="passive">are viewed</span> as <span class="weasel">likely</span> to come close to matching Keytruda's commercial success. `` One of the reasons why Rob and Ken and Roger have always talked about [ being ] therapeutic agnostic, '' Li said on Thursday, `` is because we do not know we have the foresight to know where that next revolution and where that next transformation occurs. '' `` The whole pharmaceutical field has not seen something equivalent to Keytruda at this point in time throughout the industry, '' he added.

Genicular artery embolization ( GAE) reduces inflammation in the knee to improve function and quality of life for people with moderate to severe knee pain. Osteoarthritis is one of most common causes of disability, limiting daily activities of 40% of all U.S. adults. “ Prior to treatment, patients’ knee pain had taken over their whole life, ” said Siddharth A. Padia, M.D., FSIR, professor of radiology, University of California, Los Angeles, and lead researcher of the study. “ But after treatment, patients who initially <span class="weasel">could</span> walk only three or four blocks were walking three miles. <span class="weasel">Some</span> were able to do away with walking aids, such as canes, while others reported being in a better mood now that they were living without pain. ” Until recently, arthritis pain <span class="passive">was regarded</span> as a “ wear-and-tear ” disease, but as the cartilage breaks down it releases enzymes that can cause inflammation and pain, and limit functioning. This treatment cuts down the abnormal blood flow to reduce inflammation. While it quickly improves patients’ pain, even more exciting is that the pain relief is durable—lasting for at least 12 months. This prospective, single-center, open-label FDA-approved study is the largest in the U.S. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GAE for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the knee. The study included 40 patients who were not candidates for total knee replacement, but had failed to benefit from more conservative treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, joint injections and physical therapy. Interventional radiologists navigated a catheter through a pinhole incision in the hip into the arteries in the arthritic knee. They then injected tiny particles to control the blood supply to inflamed and painful areas of the knee. The outpatient procedure took <span class="weasel">approximately</span> one to two hours, followed by a twohour recovery period. Each patient <span class="passive">was evaluated</span> for adverse events and pain scores at one week; one, three and six months; and one year after the treatment. Patients saw benefits as soon as three days after the procedure. Average pain scores decreased from 8 out of 10 before GAE to 3 out of 10 within the first week. Additionally, seven in 10 patients reported more than 50% reduction in pain scores at the one-year follow up. Minor temporary adverse events, such as transient skin discoloration and small bone infarct <span class="passive">were reported</span> in 10 patients, but resolved without treatment within days. The researchers <span class="weasel">plan to</span> conduct a randomized trial with a larger patient population to determine which patients <span class="weasel">may</span> benefit most from the treatment, as well as the impact it has on slowing the progression of arthritis.

In Asia, stocks suffered broad losses, the dollar held steady but Treasury yields and commodities weakened. European shares face moderate opening losses on Thursday following a cautious Asian session, as investors worried about the regulatory outlook in China and persistently high Covid-19 cases worldwide. This despite another <span class="weasel">robust</span> performance on Wall Street on Wednesday, where stock indexes closed further in record territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its gains to a fourth straight day after strong second-quarter corporate earnings offset doubts about the pace of economic recovery, even with the coronavirus delta variant limiting consumer and business activity in <span class="weasel">some</span> countries. `` The market <span class="passive">is focused</span> on this inflation question and whether it has an impact on Fed policy, '' said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. He added that with markets at all-time highs while also facing massive uncertainties stemming from Covid-19, fresh investment opportunities have largely dried up beyond simply backing large-cap U.S. stocks. `` There's so much uncertainty and so many conflicting pieces of information, '' Mr. Martin added, referring to the spread of the Delta variant. `` It's difficult to evaluate what happens with people and businesses. '' Looking ahead, Jerome Powell <span class="weasel">may</span> give <span class="weasel">some</span> clues as the timing of any tapering of its bond purchases on Friday at the annual Jackson Hole central bankers symposium. `` All eyes are on the Fed, '' said Joe Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, adding that while Powell <span class="weasel">might</span> hint on Friday about talk of tapering, that's different than immediately tightening financial conditions. `` There's still a lot of liquidity looking for a place to go. And the first stop is U.S. equities. '' The dollar was steady in Asia, with a slightly firmer bias ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium. While expectations have <span class="passive">been scaled</span> back and few anticipate Powell will send a clear taper signal, key Fed officials will probably stress confidence that `` substantial further <span class="weasel">progress</span> '' is on the horizon and that a slowing of asset purchases <span class="weasel">could</span> start in coming months, said Westpac. This would <span class="weasel">likely</span> leave the dollar's broad uptrend into the fourth quarter intact. Rabobank said the dollar is <span class="weasel">likely</span> the strengthen in coming months even if the Fed pushes back the timeline for tapering asset purchases. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan last Friday said he <span class="weasel">may</span> rethink his view that tapering will need to start soon if the rise in Delta coronavirus variant cases slows economic growth materially. `` While this would be a USD negative factor on one hand, Delta worries <span class="weasel">may</span> simultaneously increase its safe haven appeal, '' said Rabobank forex strategist Jane Foley. `` On balance, while pullbacks are <span class="weasel">likely</span> to be par for the course, we see scope for EUR/USD to head towards 1.16 on a six-month view. '' MUFG Bank said the euro-dollar exchange rate is showing little reaction to European-specific factors, with global risk appetite its key driver. EUR/USD is currently lower on risk aversion due to Afghanistan's fall to the Taliban, the possibility of further Chinese regulatory clampdowns, a rise in coronavirus infections in the Australian state of New South Wales and an increase in U.K. deaths, said MUFG analyst Derek Halpenny. Another factor curtailing risk is the prospect of the Fed signalling an early tapering of asset purchases at the Jackson Hole symposium, he said. `` Fragile risk sentiment provides USD <span class="weasel">support</span> and limits the impact of EUR-specific positive factors that do currently exist. '' Morgan Stanley said emerging-market currencies are <span class="weasel">likely</span> to extend losses against the dollar in the autumn on risk aversion and the prospect of the Fed starting to wind down stimulus. `` A hawkish Fed, slowing growth in EM and <span class="weasel">ongoing</span> Delta concerns all pose headwinds for EM, '' said Morgan Stanley analysts. Worries about China's coronavirus containment measures and its tighter regulations will also <span class="weasel">support</span> safe-haven flows into the dollar and put downward pressure on currencies exposed to China's growth outlook, they added. Bitcoin's pullback after rising above $ 50,000 for the first time in three months on Monday is <span class="weasel">likely</span> the result of profit taking, said cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock. A report by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows the proportion of old Bitcoins being spent on the network has increased as long-term holders take advantage of high prices to realize profits, said GlobalBlock sales trader Alexandra Clark. `` Further to this, there has been a slight uptick in inflows to exchanges, which indicates that traders and investors are capitalising on market strength and taking profits. '' Bitcoin's short-term outlook is uncertain but it <span class="weasel">should</span> benefit from a wider adoption of the cryptocurrency in the longer run, she said. U.S. Treasury yields eased back slightly in Asia after they saw their biggest one-day gains in more than two weeks on Wednesday. Economic data pointed to a continued recovery in the U.S. and Washington looked closer to an agreement on fiscal stimulus, helping spur the bond selloff. With the annual Jackson Hole gathering in view, investors have been playing down expectations that Powell will provide any fresh insights on the Fed's tapering of asset purchases, until the rate-setting FOMC's Sept. 21-22 meeting. `` Jackson Hole is more about cerebral theorizing and less about tactical announcements, '' said Bruce Monrad, portfolio manager at Northeast Investors Trust. `` It's not an FOMC meeting, so making a tactical announcement would open up the chairman to questions about what has changed since the July meeting that prompted the change in policy. '' European real estate firms have ramped up issuance of new bonds so far this year, with Vonovia's five-part bond transaction becoming the latest deal in the sector, said Commerzbank. `` The deal <span class="weasel">should</span>... see issuance from the Real Estate sector reach record levels, '' said credit strategist Cem Keltek. So far this year, European real estate companies raised a total of EUR27.6 billion in euro investment-grade corporate bonds, inching closer to the EUR29.8 billion raised in the whole of 2020. Oil prices were lower in Asia, erasing most of Wednesday's gains, although they have risen about 10% so far this week. TD Securities cautioned that the market <span class="weasel">could</span> <span class="weasel">continue</span> to face headwinds from the Covid-19 Delta variant and technical resistance levels. News emerging in the Middle East <span class="weasel">may</span> also influence oil prices. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group, said that according to reports, the U.S. is ready to make `` tough concessions '' in return for Iran's retreat from its nuclear program. Meanwhile, Israel's military is accelerating its operational plans against Iran due to the <span class="weasel">progress</span> of the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kohavi has warned, according to The Jerusalem Post. That's just a rumor for now, but <span class="weasel">could</span> `` give a bid to crude [ prices ] if it plays out, '' said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. Voice of America reported Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett will <span class="weasel">likely</span> urge Joe Biden to take a hard-line stance on Iran when the leaders meet on Thursday. Gold was a few cents lower, continuing to lose its grip on the $ 1,800 mark. Prices suffered their sharpest daily drop in more than two weeks on Wednesday, pulling back below the key level for the first time in three sessions. Metals traders await the Jackson Hole symposium, with the focus squarely on whether Powell will give a timeline for asset tapering at his speech on Friday. `` Given how the precious metal remains highly sensitive to [ Federal Reserve ] taper talk, the next few days promise to be eventful, '' Lukman Otunuga, manager, market analysis at FXTM, told MarketWatch. A dovish Powell who `` fails to provide the tapering roadmap <span class="weasel">could</span> hit the dollar, ultimately injecting gold bugs with renewed confidence, while a formal announcement on tapering <span class="weasel">could</span> `` deal a heavy blow to gold as the dollar rallies, '' said Otunuga. Copper also edged lower, as concerns over supply disruptions abated. Codelco has reached an agreement with supervisors at its Andina copper mine in Chile to freeze base pay in exchange for a one-time bonus and other incentives, said ANZ. Also, copper's limited price gains suggested the market is still wary that demand recovery <span class="weasel">may</span> be vulnerable to further weakness as the Covid-19 pandemic isn't over, ANZ added. South Korea's central bank raised its base interest rate on Thursday after 15 months of keeping it at a record low, signaling it would further dial back its easy-money policy amid an economic recovery. The rate increase makes the Bank of Korea the first major central bank in Asia to start withdrawing stimulus measures that were put in place because of the pandemic. It's pretty unlikely Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will announce in his speech Friday that the central bank is officially ready to start pulling back on its asset-buying stimulus effort, economists reckon. Mr. Powell is set to speak on Friday at 10 a.m. ET as part of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. The event <span class="passive">was moved</span> last week to an all-online format because of the rising risks <span class="weasel">around</span> the coronavirus pandemic.
