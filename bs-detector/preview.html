The two companies will collaborate to market Verogen’ s forensically validated next generation sequencing ( NGS) workflows alongside QIAGEN’ s full range of forensic-grade chemistries and sample prep automation to provide a full sample to ID solutions for human identification laboratories. Under the partnership, Germany-based QIAGEN will have rights to globally distribute both current and future Verogen products. Verogen’ s tools <span class="weasel">aim</span> to improve human identification beyond a DNA profile. Next generation sequencing is currently used in multiple biotech fields, including oncology research and testing for rare diseases. For the forensics field, NGS opens new opportunities to <span class="weasel">support</span> law enforcement efforts to solve missing person cases, criminal cases and victims of disasters. NGS provides additional capabilities, such as the estimation of externally visible characteristics like hair or eye color. The process elevates DNA testing from passive forensic <span class="weasel">support</span> to a proactive investigational technique. The partnership <span class="passive">is expected</span> to offer forensic clients a higher level of end-to-end <span class="weasel">support</span> across the globe, from sample collection to data interpretation and analysis. Verogen Chief Executive Officer Brett Williams said the partnership with QIAGEN will make it easier for laboratories to provide impactful answers and will allow for the accelerated adoption of next-generation sequencing ( NGS) in forensic operations. Thiery Bernard, QIAGEN’ s chief executive officer, said the partnership will combine Verogen’ s innovative NGS workflows with QIAGEN’ s portfolio of Sample to Insight solutions, which will create “ the most comprehensive product offering for forensics applications. ” He also said the partnership with Verogen will <span class="weasel">enable</span> customers to gain greater insights from their casework samples and <span class="weasel">drive</span> NGS adoption in human identification. He predicted the partnership will “ ultimately strengthen justice systems all over the world. ” The deal with Verogen comes one week after QIAGEN launched its QIAprep & CRISPR Kit and CRISPR Q-Primer Solutions program that allows researchers to more closely analyze edited genetic material to determine how gene editing interventions have changed the function of DNA sequences in question. The CRISPR kits mark the company’ s dedicated solutions for a fast-growing gene editing market. The company said the CRISPR products provide research teams with an “ all-in-one process ” for the characterization of “ so-called knock-outs generated from guide RNA ( gRNA) and knock-ins from small insertions during gene editing. ” Thomas Schweins, head of Life Sciences at QIAGEN, said the new CRISPR tools will reduce the time to result in gene editing experiments.

This is the latest offering in a growing portfolio of sustainability-specific software applications that help businesses increase their measurement and data management capabilities. As sustainable business regulations, such as plastic taxes, are put in place, the SAP Responsible Design and Production solution enables brands to accelerate their transition to circular-economy business practices. The new solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics. As businesses increasingly develop sustainable products, managing materials and regulatory data is becoming one of the most complex challenges across the consumer industry today. “ The circular economy <span class="passive">is based</span> on three principles, driven by design — eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature, ” said Andrew Morlet, CEO, Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “ Digital solutions play an important role in the transition to a circular economy. They <span class="weasel">enable</span> businesses to embed circular practices across their operations, from designing products to reduce waste from the outset, to tracking the lifecycle of the materials they use. ” With SAP’ s new solution, businesses can embed circularity principles into core business processes, helping eliminate waste and unlock new value by designing products to be sustainable from inception. For example, a shampoo brand manager has visibility into the full product lifecycle, including their extended producer responsibility ( EPR) obligations and the plastic taxes of different markets. This visibility helps the brand manager make design changes to reduce waste and decisions on how to lower the costs of the downstream reuse and recycling systems. “ Every year, we use almost twice the amount of resources than the planet can regenerate, ” said Scott Russell, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and head of Customer Success, “ Business can play a crucial role in keeping value in our systems for longer through smart, responsible product design that reuses resources rather than disposing of them. There is inherent complexity in designing products that eliminate waste and use responsible materials, but SAP Responsible Design and Production tackles that complexity and offers a ‘ gold-standard’ solution to our customers, helping to deliver circular products and achieve a regenerative economy. ” SAP Responsible Design and Production, a cloud-native solution co-developed with Accenture on SAP Business Technology Platform, provides tailored intelligence that enables businesses to keep pace with EPR regulations and plastic taxes, embed circularity principles into core business processes and optimize design for sustainable business.

This altitude record once again serves as a proof of LGES battery-powered EV's outstanding performance, even in the harshest driving environment. '' `` Our goal was to show everyone the potential of electromobility by demonstrating how electric vehicles maintain their top level of performance even at extreme altitudes, '' said Zietlow. LG Energy Solution has been leading the battery manufacturing industry since 1992 based on its long-standing legacy in research and development ( R & D) of groundbreaking battery technology. In 2009, the company became the world's first battery manufacturer to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and has been expanding its portfolio to a diverse range of products and customers ever since. In the last decade alone, LG Energy Solution has invested USD 4.5 billion in R & D which has resulted in the company now holding a vast number of intellectual properties - nearly 23,000 patents worldwide - in materials and core technologies.

The majority of biopharma companies now have explicit goals and commitments related to patient access at the executive level and in their mission statements. The role of the access function is rapidly evolving and access objectives <span class="passive">are shared</span> across multiple functions. The access function orchestrates these objectives across the organization to ensure timely, equitable, and sustainable patient access, expanding beyond the traditional focus on technical issues like health economic models, evidence synthesis, and pricing research. The evolving role of “ access ” requires us to rethink how companies can operationalize the broader role of global access in this new environment. This report provides a joint perspective of the BCG Market Access Roundtable members. In this joint perspective, we seek to lay out three topics: How have access objectives evolved? Description of the evolution of access objectives and measures reflecting today’ s expanded scope of access. What is the ideal access contribution toward these objectives? Outlines key elements of how access can contribute at the enterprise level. What are activities of access functions to deliver on these contributions? Articulation of key considerations <span class="weasel">around</span> operationalizing the broader role of access. The BCG Market Access Roundtable is a forum that brings together senior market access leaders and serves as a platform for interactive discussion on industry-level topics. Roundtable members collectively select topics that are relevant but not handled in other forums, and which can have either near- and/or long-term relevance. Members work in smaller working groups on specific topics to develop thought pieces, relevant frameworks, or policy-related publications, which are collectively ratified by the Roundtable on a biannual basis. The Boston Consulting Group ( BCG) hosts the roundtable and facilitates these forums and the working groups. As of this year, 28 companies are full-time members of the BCG Market Access Roundtable ( see list below). <span class="weasel">Several</span> key developments within and beyond the healthcare system have impacted patient access and the role of access functions within biopharma companies, which <span class="passive">are summarized</span> in more detail in “ Access in the New World. ” 1 As the role of access is expanding, key outcomes for access have also evolved. Objectives have shifted from a functional focus to shared outcomes with other functions, such as medical, regulatory, commercial, and their respective stakeholder counterparts in the healthcare ecosystem. Historically, access objectives were price achieved, time to reimbursement, or breadth of coverage. Success or progress toward these objectives can be measured or tracked with key performance indicators ( KPIs), such as production of key deliverables on time and budget ( e.g., value dossier, health economics models, pricing strategy, etc.) or number and quality of interactions with internal and external stakeholders. The scope of access today has expanded beyond reimbursement to “ getting drugs in the hands of patients ” and ultimately adoption. State-of-the-art access outcomes are patients treated, patients with choice to benefit from the medicine, or measures of health equity.2 Relevant KPIs have also changed to joint efforts such as the co-creation of a NHS National Cancer Plan; resolution on pressing health issues like antimicrobial resistance; the Memorandum of Understanding for access with the Ministry of Health in Ontario Canda; or concrete steps to increase the value, affordability, and capacity for innovative drug treatment. We anchor the discussion on these joint outcomes at the healthcare ecosystem level, summarized as “ access to optimal care in a sustainable fashion. ” <span class="weasel">Several</span> contributions from access <span class="passive">are required</span> at the enterprise level to achieve these joint outcomes. The different contributions address internal and external stakeholders, and need to happen at and above the product level. From these types of contribution, we derive implications for operationalizing access activities and deliverables at a functional level. In “ Building Access Competencies for the future, ” 3 we further provide an overview of new and advanced access competencies required to <span class="weasel">enable</span> functional operationalization and delivery. To <span class="weasel">enable</span> successful delivery of the shared outcome “ access to optimal care in a sustainable fashion ” at the healthcare ecosystem level, the access function has a critical role along four internal and four external dimensions. Contributions can further be split into product level and above product/portfolio level. In the following section, we <span class="weasel">aim</span> to provide an overview of the <span class="weasel">various</span> elements and examples of what a meaningful or impactful contribution <span class="weasel">could</span> be. Access leaders have a key role to <span class="weasel">drive</span> organizational decision-making and steer strategic discussions at the executive level. This becomes particularly critical when interdependencies exist between decisions of access stakeholders and other stakeholders, which are traditionally seen to be the sole remit of other functions. Key contributions from an internal perspective can be summarized along the four themes ahead. 1. Provide the voice of health technology assessment ( HTA), payer, and policy stakeholders at and above the product level for pipeline and business development investments 2. Champion integrated evidence and commercial strategies that define, demonstrate, and capture the broad value of a product 3. <span class="weasel">Drive</span> societal and health system considerations on value, affordability, and health outcomes within a broader environmental, social, and governance ( ESG) agenda 4. Frame strategic access trade-offs across pipeline, portfolio, franchise, and products The roundtable identified four additional areas where access leaders can contribute and steer decision-making in forums with external stakeholder groups. Understanding and co-creating the environment with these stakeholders is crucial to achieve joint outcomes with a positive impact at the healthcare ecosystem level. 1. Advocate change in health systems to ensure timely and equitable patient access 2. Co-create sustainable access, funding, and value-assessment mechanisms leveraging real-world evidence ( RWE) and patient experience 3. Ensure value of diagnostics, drugs, and devices is consistently communicated 4. Contribute to financial incentives and price realization for commercial success and sustained investment in innovation When thinking about how to operationalize delivery of the contributions outlined, four key concepts need to be embedded in the functional setup and processes of the access function. To ensure structured discussions on value, access, and evidence can happen early and with the relevant decision-makers, access needs to have a “ seat at the table ” from early development across the entire life cycle. In these cross-functional decision fora, the access function <span class="passive">is required</span> to provide access enterprise leadership and formalize shared objectives in integrated disease area and brand strategies. Elevating the mandate of access by establishing access as a key function at the executive level and appointing a single point of contact with full accountability5 represent critical measures to operationalize access as a corporate objective within a broader ESG agenda and communication strategy. Given access is essentially local in nature, close collaboration with key countries for early strategy development and operational <span class="weasel">support</span> during and after product launch is key to achieve shared objectives in the local healthcare ecosystem. In the following paragraphs, we seek to lay out <span class="weasel">some</span> key exemplary activities or process measures for how the four concepts can be implemented successfully in an organization. These operationalization elements <span class="weasel">aim</span> to <span class="weasel">support</span> articulation of the value and unique contribution of access as a strategic partner to the business. They <span class="weasel">should</span> represent a set of guiding principles rather than a structural blueprint—as the structural setup of organizations is individually tailored toward their needs ( as it <span class="weasel">should</span> be). Buy-in of senior company leadership outside the access function is essential to <span class="weasel">enable</span> the operationalization of the broader role of access.</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Merck KGaA</td><td>marketscreener</td><td>business</td><td>0.316</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td><div class="txt">Hong Kong shares dropped on Monday, dragged by healthcare stocks, but investors were closely watching beleaguered developer China Evergrande, whose shares <span class="passive">were suspended</span> ahead of an announcement about a major transaction. * * The Hang Seng Index closed 2.19% lower at 24,036.37, while the China Enterprises Index lost 2.35% to 8,521.19. * * Mainland Chinese markets <span class="passive">were closed</span> for a public holiday. * * Embattled developer China Evergrande will sell a half-stake in its property management unit to Hopson Development for more than $ 5 billion, Chinese media said on Monday, after both Evergrande and Hopson requested trading halts ahead of a major transaction. * * Shares in Evergrande's electric vehicle unit gained 29.14%. * * Property stocks fell but performed better than the broader market.

The event, labeled a `` serious incident '' by the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety ( BEA), <span class="passive">was caused</span> by an incorrect altimeter setting. As reported by The Aviation Herald, the aircraft, a 22-year-old Airbus A320-200 registered as 9H-EMU, was operating flight D8-4311 from Stockholm Arlanda ( ARN) to Paris Charles de Gaulle ( CDG) and on a Required Navigation Performance ( RNP) approach to CDG's runway 27R. However, the crew had selected the wrong pressure indication for the altimeter. Instead of QNH 1001hPa, the approach controller had told them 1011 Pa. As such, the plane was coming in at 250 feet below the glide path. This triggered a Minimum Safe Altitude Warning ( MSAW). The crew initiated a low-altitude go-<span class="weasel">around</span> at about 1NM before the runway threshold without having acquired visual contact with the ground. The aircraft reached a minimum of 405 feet according to QNH 1001hPa, which according to the QNH 1011 hPa setting would have read 679 feet. According to the AV Herald, the radio altimeter indicated six feet above ground level. After contact with the control tower, the plane climbed back to 5,000 feet and circled <span class="weasel">around</span> for another attempt.

For the first time, scientists at the University of Oxford and the University of Washington have directly linked human-induced climate change to the risk of flooding from a glacial lake known as one of the world's greatest flood risks. The study examined the case of Lake Palcacocha in the Peruvian Andes, which <span class="weasel">could</span> cause flooding with devastating consequences for 120,000 residents in the city of Huaraz. The paper, published Feb. 4 in Nature Geoscience, provides new evidence for an ongoing legal case that hinges on the link between greenhouse gas emissions and particular climate change impacts. `` The scientific challenge was to provide the clearest and cleanest assessment of the physical linkages between climate change and the changing flood hazard, '' said co-author Gerard Roe, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences. In 2016, Roe and colleagues developed a method to determine whether an individual glacier's retreat can be linked to human-induced climate change. The retreat of mountain glaciers has <span class="weasel">several</span> consequences, including creating basins in the space left by the retreating glacier. Precipitation and meltwater collects in these basins to form glacial lakes. Recent work has shown a rapid worldwide growth in the number and size of high-elevation glacial lakes. `` We <span class="weasel">believe</span> our study is the first to assess the full set of linkages between anthropogenic climate change and the changing glacial lake outburst flood hazard, '' Roe said. `` The methods used in our study can certainly be applied to other glacial lakes <span class="weasel">around</span> the world. '' Huaraz is a Peruvian city of about 120,000 residents that lies 1.8 miles ( 3 kilometers) above sea level, in view of Palcaraju Glacier and other peaks in the Cordillera Blanca mountains. Credit: Uwebart/Wikimedia The new study first calculated the role of human emissions in the observed temperature increase since the start of the industrial era <span class="weasel">around</span> Palcaraju Glacier. It finds that human activity is responsible for 95% of the observed 1 degree Celsius ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warming in this region since 1880. The authors then used the UW-developed technique to assess the relationship between these warming temperatures and the observed long-term retreat of the glacier that has caused Lake Palcacocha to expand. Results show it is virtually certain, with greater than 99% probability, that human-induced climate change has caused Palcaraju Glacier's retreat. Lead author Rupert Stuart-Smith, a doctoral student at Oxford, then used two methods to assess the hazard of glacial lake outburst flooding, in which an avalanche, landslide or rockfall induces a tsunami wave that overtops the lake's banks, to pinpoint how Lake Palcacocha's growth affects the flood risk faced by the city of Huaraz below. `` We found that human influence on climate—through greenhouse-gas emissions—is responsible for virtually all of the warming that has <span class="passive">been observed</span> in the region, '' said Stuart-Smith, who spent the summer of 2019 at the UW. `` The study shows that warming has caused the retreat of the Palcaraju Glacier, which in turn has greatly increased the flood risk. '' The study provides new evidence for an ongoing case in the German courts in which Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a farmer from Huaraz, has sued RWE, Germany's largest electricity producer, for its role in creating global warming. The suit seeks reimbursement for current and future flood-risk reduction measures. Lake Palcacocha last burst its banks in 1941, killing at least 1,800 people in the city of Huaraz. Known as one of the world's most dangerous lakes, its water level has risen in recent years with the shrinking of Palcaraju Glacier, which lies directly to the north. Credit: Georg Kaser/Wikimedia `` Crucially, our findings establish a direct link between emissions and the need to implement protective measures now, as well as any damages caused by flooding in the future, '' Stuart-Smith said. This is not the first time Huaraz has <span class="passive">been threatened</span> by climate change. In 1941, an outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha, resulting from an ice and rock slide, killed at least 1,800 people. The study also found this flood to be influenced by human-induced climate change—making it one of the earliest identified fatal impacts of climate change. The lake's recent growth strains decades of engineering efforts since the 1970s to contain the lake's water. `` <span class="weasel">Around</span> the world, the retreat of mountain glaciers is one of the clearest indicators of climate change, '' Roe said. `` Outburst floods threaten communities in many mountainous regions, but this risk is particularly severe in Huaraz, as well as elsewhere in the Andes and in countries like Nepal and Bhutan, where vulnerable populations live in the path of the potential floodwaters.

The suit seeks reimbursement for current and future flood-risk reduction measures. `` Crucially, our findings establish a direct link between emissions and the need to implement protective measures now, as well as any damages caused by flooding in the future, '' Stuart-Smith said. This is not the first time Huaraz has <span class="passive">been threatened</span> by climate change. In 1941, an outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha, resulting from an ice and rock slide, killed at least 1,800 people. The study also found this flood to be influenced by human-induced climate change—making it one of the earliest identified fatal impacts of climate change. The lake's recent growth strains decades of engineering efforts since the 1970s to contain the lake's water. `` <span class="weasel">Around</span> the world, the retreat of mountain glaciers is one of the clearest indicators of climate change, '' Roe said. `` Outburst floods threaten communities in many mountainous regions, but this risk is particularly severe in Huaraz, as well as elsewhere in the Andes and in countries like Nepal and Bhutan, where vulnerable populations live in the path of the potential floodwaters.

The drug is a PD-1 inhibitor or checkpoint inhibitor. The FDA had recently granted full approval to Merck's own blockbuster checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda ( pembrolizumab), for the same indication, and the agency recommended Agenus withdraw the application. Agenus’ s BLA was <span class="passive">being reviewed</span> under an Accelerated Approval pathway as well as Fast Track and Priority Review designations. The target action date was December 16, 2021. Agenus indicates it plans to continue its development strategies for balstilimab in combination with other drugs. Merck’ s Keytruda <span class="passive">was granted</span> accelerated approval in second-line cervical cancer in 2018. Then, in mid-October, the FDA granted it first-line approval with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. The trial was not only for first-line advanced cervical cancer but also a confirmatory trial for the accelerated approval, allowing the agency to convert the accelerated approval over to a standard approval. “ While the commercial market for balstilimab monotherapy in second-line cervical cancer was always anticipated to be small, Agenus’ priority remains developing balstilimab as a necessary component of highly effective and affordable combination therapies, both with its own portfolio and with partners, including in combination with Agenus’ next-generation CTLA-4, AGEN1181, ” said Garo Armen, chief executive officer and chairman of Agenus. Agenus plans to discontinue its ongoing confirmatory trial. Shares plunged 22% to $ 3.98 in premarket trading today at the news. It is also expected to decrease its research and development expenses by more than $ 100 million due to the shift. Because the drug has demonstrated clinical benefit, the company is considering launching an expanded access program that would allow patients and doctors access to the drug in <span class="weasel">several</span> countries, including the U.S. Although the company statement indicates it is voluntarily withdrawing the BLA, reporting suggests the company is not happy with the decision and that Armen has written to the FDA’ s Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA’ s Oncology Center of Excellence for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, to intervene. “ This seemingly quick approval of pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) hours before Agenus’ s late-cycle meeting suggests that FDA <span class="weasel">may</span> have afforded special consideration to Merck, the sponsor of the pembrolizumab application, ” Armen wrote to Pazdur. “ The fact that pembrolizumab’ s approval blocked Agenus’ s chances of accelerated approval further implies that FDA was not intending to afford balstilimab the full and fair review that it deserves. ” There have been suggestions that the FDA is getting tougher on accelerated approvals. They are usually granted for drugs with a high unmet need but require the companies to run post-marketing studies to determine if the drugs are as effective as they seem to be in earlier trials. Accelerated approvals are typically based on surrogate endpoints, such as biomarker readouts, rather than a specific clinical benefit. <span class="weasel">Several</span> accelerated approvals have <span class="passive">been rescinded</span> this year and <span class="weasel">some</span> unexpected rejections to <span class="weasel">support</span> the argument that the agency is getting tougher on accelerated approvals. On March 1, Merck voluntarily withdrew the U.S. indication for Keytruda for metastatic small cell lung cancer ( SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other previous line of therapy.

Continental has developed a tire with a significantly improved rolling resistance for Peugeot, DS and Opel vehicles with electric <span class="weasel">drive</span> and combustion engine. All electric SUVs Peugeot e-2008, the Opel MOKKA-E and the all-electric DS 3 Crossback E-TENSE, as well as all combustion engine versions of these models will be factory-equipped with the 17-inch tire. The tire <span class="passive">is based</span> on a Continental EcoContact 6 ( 215/60 R17 96H). Its energy efficiency classification exceeds the EU tire label value A requirements by <span class="weasel">around</span> 17 percent, which means it has a particularly low rolling resistance. It has also received the top EU tire label rating A for wet grip. This development achievement by Continental's tire engineers and materials experts is all the more remarkable since the reduction of rolling resistance and exceptionally high braking performance are conflicting physical targets. While driving, energy loss <span class="weasel">should</span> be kept as low as possible to minimize rolling resistance. However, the opposite is true for braking: To keep braking distance to a minimum, tires need to dissipate as much energy as possible. The improvements <span class="passive">were achieved</span> thanks to a new sidewall structure and a special rubber compound for the tread. `` We developed a tire with outstanding properties for Stellantis, and it received top marks for rolling resistance and wet braking performance. We achieved these properties through a new sidewall concept and a special rubber compound for the tread. Our experts have once again pushed the physical boundaries for greater safety and efficiency on the road, '' says Dr. Holger Lange, heading the tire development for Continental's original equipment business. In the context of the new sidewall concept, the engineers also refined the use of <span class="weasel">various</span> high-performance compounds during development and production. For example, an additional compound inside the sidewall creates less rolling resistance. A second compound ensures that the outer tire sidewall remains tough enough to withstand everyday situations in road traffic and environmental influences such as curb contact and UV radiation. The third compound <span class="passive">is designed</span> to ensure the robustness of the tire in the rim area. Rolling resistance optimization plays a major role in tire development, especially for electric vehicles. After all, a reduced rolling resistance has a measurable and positive effect on the environment. It also helps reduce the energy consumption of a vehicle, increasing the range of electric vehicles by three to four percent. Confirmed by leading vehicle manufacturers, Continental's internal calculations conclude that a 15 percent reduction in rolling resistance for an internal combustion engine ( all other conditions being equal) can achieve fuel savings of <span class="weasel">around</span> 0.1 liters per 100 kilometers. This results in a reduction in CO2 emissions of <span class="weasel">approximately</span> two grams of CO2 per kilometer. Carmakers throughout the world rely on Continental as a leading tire manufacturer. Almost every third vehicle in Europe comes off the production line with Continental tires. Continental supplies six of the world's ten most successful manufacturers of electric vehicles with tires ex-works. Continental's tire replacement business also offers a wide range of summer, winter and all-season tires for Stellantis electric and combustion vehicles, including many tire test winners. The EcoContact 6 215/60 R17 96H has been factory-approved in many countries for the Peugeot e-2008, the Opel MOKKA-E and the DS 3 Crossback E-TENSE and their internal combustion engine versions.

The three European Supervisory Authorities ( ESAs) issued a 42-page “ call for evidence ” to gauge the scale of exaggerated environmental, social and governance investing statements as they try to find out how well existing regulations are working. The move, announced on Tuesday, acts on a mandate by the European Commission that was given in <span class="weasel">May</span>. The probe coincides with a wave of ESG fund reclassifications as asset managers react to clarifications to the EU’ s anti-greenwash rulebook, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. In an effort to navigate the new landscape, investment firms are increasingly relying on lawyers, according to those representing the industry. The ESA review targets banks, insurers, pensions, benchmark administrators, asset managers and investors. The regulators have asked the financial market participants to respond to questions relating to everything from senior management’ s role in sustainability to “ underlying drivers of greenwashing. ” Firms are also expected to provide examples. In an apparent effort to allay fears of the legal repercussions of providing responses, the ESAs made clear that reported examples of greenwashing would be used to advise the commission on possible remedies. “ The purpose of this survey is to gather useful and concrete examples that will help the ESAs to better understand greenwashing, ” according to the document. Reported greenwashing cases “ are mainly sought for the purpose of informing the advice which the ESAs would provide to the European Commission. ” Those responding “ <span class="weasel">may</span> either give full details about the actual names of the entities or products involved in a potential greenwashing practice, or you <span class="weasel">may</span> refer to them as ‘ entity X’, ‘ product Y’. ” The ESAs <span class="passive">are scheduled</span> to deliver an initial report by <span class="weasel">May</span> 31 and a final report a year later.

Genicular artery embolization ( GAE) reduces inflammation in the knee to improve function and quality of life for people with moderate to severe knee pain. Osteoarthritis is one of most common causes of disability, limiting daily activities of 40% of all U.S. adults. “ Prior to treatment, patients’ knee pain had taken over their whole life, ” said Siddharth A. Padia, M.D., FSIR, professor of radiology, University of California, Los Angeles, and lead researcher of the study. “ But after treatment, patients who initially <span class="weasel">could</span> walk only three or four blocks were walking three miles. <span class="weasel">Some</span> were able to do away with walking aids, such as canes, while others reported being in a better mood now that they were living without pain. ” Until recently, arthritis pain <span class="passive">was regarded</span> as a “ wear-and-tear ” disease, but as the cartilage breaks down it releases enzymes that can cause inflammation and pain, and limit functioning. This treatment cuts down the abnormal blood flow to reduce inflammation. While it quickly improves patients’ pain, even more exciting is that the pain relief is durable—lasting for at least 12 months. This prospective, single-center, open-label FDA-approved study is the largest in the U.S. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GAE for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the knee. The study included 40 patients who were not candidates for total knee replacement, but had failed to benefit from more conservative treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, joint injections and physical therapy. Interventional radiologists navigated a catheter through a pinhole incision in the hip into the arteries in the arthritic knee. They then injected tiny particles to control the blood supply to inflamed and painful areas of the knee. The outpatient procedure took <span class="weasel">approximately</span> one to two hours, followed by a twohour recovery period. Each patient <span class="passive">was evaluated</span> for adverse events and pain scores at one week; one, three and six months; and one year after the treatment. Patients saw benefits as soon as three days after the procedure. Average pain scores decreased from 8 out of 10 before GAE to 3 out of 10 within the first week. Additionally, seven in 10 patients reported more than 50% reduction in pain scores at the one-year follow up. Minor temporary adverse events, such as transient skin discoloration and small bone infarct <span class="passive">were reported</span> in 10 patients, but resolved without treatment within days. The researchers <span class="weasel">plan to</span> conduct a randomized trial with a larger patient population to determine which patients <span class="weasel">may</span> benefit most from the treatment, as well as the impact it has on slowing the progression of arthritis.

This mid-year update from the excellent Climate Tech VC newsletter suggests there were roughly 250 deals this year as of June 30, representing about $ 16 billion in funding. One data point you’ ll appreciate: There were 50 percent more contracts disclosed during the second quarter, compared with a year earlier; although last year many investors held on to their money during the COVID-19 uncertainty, so <span class="weasel">consider</span> that stat with caution. Still, that amount is just what has already been specifically dedicated to startups and ventures. There’ s beaucoup more moolah waiting in the wings — swelling private equity funds such as Brookfield’ s Global Transition Fund ( with $ 7 billion to start) and the TPG Rise Climate Fund ( with $ 5.4 billion). Investors who participated in the cleantech movement observe one big thing that makes the current spending spree different: the participation of traditional investors who have become interested in the economic opportunity linked to addressing climate change. `` Climate tech is much broader and includes things that cleantech would not have counted, '' said Valerie Shen, partner and COO of G2 Venture Partners, which recently closed its second $ 500 million fund dedicated to climate tech. At least half the firm’ s limited partners are actively engaged in `` searching for the sustainability piece, '' and the fund tracks the carbon emissions impact of its portfolio on an annual basis. Shen added: `` There is a realization that so many things are heavily impactful for climate. '' Over the past year, the `` extreme politicization '' of climate discussions has started to shift, another reason for the mainstream shift, noted Andrew Beebe, managing director of Obvious Ventures. `` All sides are recognizing that this is a non-partisan issue in the problem statement, '' he told me. `` When those things happen, investors start to recognize the foundation. When there is massive upheaval, there’ s usually massive amounts of money to be made. '' One more reason for the shift in perspective, Beebe suggests, is the increasingly `` world positive '' perspective of Generation Z. A growing number of entrepreneurs and founders are considering climate change and the decarbonization of the economy as part of their core value proposition. `` This <span class="weasel">could</span> change every single aspect of the way that we move goods and people, '' he observed. Naturally, the monetary <span class="weasel">support</span> flowing into climate tech startups is coming in many shapes, reflecting the increasingly diverse and mainstream nature of the opportunity. One intriguing model that came to my attention earlier this month <span class="passive">is embraced</span> by BCG Green Ventures, a newly created climate tech incubation program that’ s part of Boston Consulting Group’ s digital ventures arm. The mandate: Partner with corporations to help them identify business opportunities related to climate tech, then jointly incubate and invest in those ventures. The effort evolved out of inquiries to BCG’ s broader venture arm, which has helped build close to 160 businesses ranging from an artificial intelligence-power lab assistant to an online used car platform ( which it created in collaboration with Volkswagen). `` The businesses we build will tackle both the operational decarbonization side of the equation, addressing both Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and the opportunity angle, supporting corporates through the inception and growth of new, green revenue streams, '' wrote Stefan Gross-Selbeck, global managing director and senior partners of BCG Digital Ventures, in a blog announcing the BCG Green Ventures initiative. When I spoke with Gross-Selbeck, he said the idea is to `` combine the speed and agility of a startup with the traditional assets of a much larger corporation. '' Typically BCG is responsible for recruiting talent, and helping teams manage project and development cycles. Most of the funding comes from the corporate partner, and the BCG ventures team <span class="passive">is compensated</span> for meeting certain key performance indicators. <span class="weasel">Several</span> projects are already under way. Utopus Insights, a partnership with IBM, is a software company that uses energy analytics to help integrate renewable power into the grid. OpenSC is a supply chain traceability platform that BCG developed in collaboration with WWF. Another example is SiFAB, which is working on silicon anode materials technologies that <span class="weasel">could</span> result in denser batteries and charge more quickly and have a longer life. The corporate partner is Unifrax, a specialty materials company. Many of these companies will have access to BCG CO2, a software tool built by BCG that helps organizations track greenhouse gas emissions along their entire value chain. While BCG’ s new initiative has a broad purview, Gross-Selbeck said that many initial projects will center on using artificial intelligence and other digital technologies to help more quickly identify and optimize breakthroughs for mobility and materials. `` Generally speaking, we <span class="weasel">believe</span> that 70 percent to 80 percent of what needs to be achieved can be achieved by scaling up existing technology, '' he said. Gross-Selbeck believes you can think of these things as falling into Scope 4 ( what?) on the GHG spectrum, representing developments that help companies begin to more credibly build their stories <span class="weasel">around</span> the `` avoided emissions '' associated with their products and services.

According to the J.D. Power 2021 Canada Customer Service Index—Long-Term ( CSI-LT) Study, SM released today, the total size of the four- to 12-year-old automotive service market plunged to $ 6.6 billion in 2021 from $ 9.2 billion in 2020. With fewer kilometres driven and a shortage of service availability in <span class="weasel">some</span> major markets, the industry experienced a drop in total service occasions of almost 20% year over year, with aftermarket locations capturing 54% of those service occasions remaining, compared with 46% for new-vehicle dealers. What’ s more, aftermarket locations increased their share of overall industry revenue to 44% in 2021 from 40% in 2020, representing a swing of more than $ 200 million in relative revenue share. This reverses a multi-year trend of new-vehicle dealerships steadily taking a greater share of revenue. The study also finds that while dealerships had more than 3.5 million fewer service visits year over year, the average cost per service at those dealerships also fell to $ 332 from $ 375 a year ago. Total revenues are also down in the aftermarket, with the average spend among non-dealer facilities decreasing to $ 226 from $ 241 in 2020. In total, dealer revenues fell <span class="weasel">approximately</span> $ 1.83 billion while non-dealer service facilities declined $ 725 million. “ We’ re seeing the effect of broader macro-economic forces in the automotive space, ” said J.D. Ney, automotive practice lead at J.D. Power Canada. “ Besides the decline in service visits and revenue, there is a bright spot for the service business. Many vehicle owners opted to make more expensive repairs to their current vehicle rather than to trade it in for a new vehicle or absorb the added cost of a pre-owned vehicle, where we’ ve seen prices soar recently. ” While the number of customer visits and spend per visit declines year over year, overall satisfaction with auto service departments remains constant. Combined overall satisfaction with dealerships and non-dealers is 791 ( on a 1,000-point scale), which <span class="passive">is unchanged</span> from 2020. Satisfaction with non-dealers averages 796 and satisfaction with dealerships averages 786. Audi Dealerships ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for a second consecutive year, with a score of 825. Great Canadian Oil Change ( 823) ranks second and Volkswagen Dealerships ( 817) ranks third.</div></td></tr>
